<h2>THE KING’S COMRADE</h2>

<h3 id="KINGS_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STATE CRUST</span></h3>

<p>The early September night had descended upon
Bruges,—“City of Bridges,”—once the seat of the
most luxurious court in Europe, now so far away,
fallen from its high if not from its wealthy estate. The
life of the little town, never very active or varied
under the Spaniard’s rule, seemed this evening to
have been swept into a stillness emphasised only by
an occasional footfall upon the cobbles of its winding
streets, some husky cry from a barge gliding ghost-like
down a canal, or the far-away barking of dogs on
the farm lands beyond the walls. A sea mist had
crept from the north, muffling even these sounds of
silence, rolling in thicker volumes along the many
sluggard waters that intersect the old Flemish Mart
and bring prosperity to her comfortable merchants,
as it were in their sleep. It hung itself in loose wisps
around the carven towers of the Cathedral, the giddy
heights of the belfry—whence, as the hours slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
on, deep bell voices answered clear bell voices, like
spirits communing from their heights across the petty
lives below.</p>

<p class="tb">The corner house of a row of solid burgher mansions,
flanking the canal on the Quai Vert, stood
slightly apart with an air of greater importance than
the rest, giving to the street on the one side through
courtyard and wrought-iron gate, and on the other
sheer over the water that lazily lipped the green,
slimy foot of its walls.</p>

<p>The second floor of this house had been the dwelling
of my lord Viscount Rockhurst ever since—that
is, some two years before—Charles had transferred
to Bruges his penurious little court of English
Cavaliers, exiles like himself since the fateful days
of Worcester, of Boscobel, and Whiteladies.</p>

<p>In a long, low room overlooking the canal, two
men sat together, one on each side of an open hearth,
lost in deep musings. The curtains were undrawn;
one window stood open, and ever and anon admitted
a wreath of the sea-fog that swirled a moment and
swiftly fainted away. The only light in the apartment
was the ruddy glow of a driftwood fire, now
cheerfully burning, although the acrid savour that
still hung in the air betrayed its recent stubbornness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and explained the gaping casement. It seemed as if
the two lacked the energy either to shut out the gloom
of night or call for the enlivening of candle or lamp;
as if the paralysing, sodden weight lying upon the
world without had laid hold of their souls.</p>

<p>The blue-tipped flames that leaped round the logs
flung now one brooding countenance in relief, now
the other. Upon the right, the dark head of the
exiled King of England, still in the very ripeness of
young manhood, would be sketched against the
leather-backed chair upon which it wearily rested.
But not all the geniality of the blaze could give
sanguine hue or gleam of cheerfulness to the sallow,
harsh visage. In utter dejection, the long figure—“a
tall man, above two yards high,” so had run the
description on the Council of State’s Warrant for
the apprehension of Charles Stuart—extended
itself as if unconsciously to the warmth, chin sunk
upon breast, eyes fixed and moody under drooping
lids and singularly bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>Upon the left, the fitful tongues of flame revealed
a face of equal melancholy if of greater energy and
comeliness. My lord Rockhurst sat forward, supporting
his cheek upon his hand. His was a type such
as Sir Anthony Van Dyck, some few years before,
had loved to fix in his incomparable line and colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Like his King he was dark, but with chestnut lights
and a crispness in the waves of hair falling upon his
shoulders absent from the heavy locks of Charles.
Against the glow his profile stood out, fine-cut and
pale-hued as a carving in ivory. Older by some
years, there yet was a youthful air of alertness about
his whole personality, even as he sat motionless, that
was conspicuously lacking in the apathetic figure
facing him.</p>

<p>Ever and anon his eyes, hawk-like in their keenness
and the quick dilation of their pupils, would shift
from the wistful contemplation of fire-pictures to the
royal countenance, where they would rest in scrutiny,
and, it seemed, in deepening concern. Ever and
anon, upon the withdrawal of this gaze, a slight sigh
escaped him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Charles gathered his long limbs into a
more erect posture, and jerking his head toward his
companion:—</p>

<p>“And there you go again, Harry, with your heigh-ho’s.
I fled but an hour ago from the long faces of
my lord Gerard, of Erskine, and Armorer—”</p>

<p>“My lord Gerard, gentleman of the Bedchamber,
Messieurs Erskine and Armorer, Cupbearer and
Comptroller of the Household—” murmured Rockhurst,
with a humorous twist of bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gentleman of the Straw Pallet and Wooden
Stool … Comptroller of the State Crusts! As for
Mr. Cupbearer Erskine, he had to-day to pledge
in pawn the last silver pot for fear of arrest.…
Marry! I took refuge with you, who at least, God
be praised, never weary me with talk of debts.
Yet even you must need treat me to sighs! Upon
my soul, a man would no more cheerful company than
that of this Court of mine to put him in fit frame for
the monastery—How say you, Harry? Is’t perchance
the one issue left us? There is Royal, aye,
Imperial example for it. Do you see in me proper
material for a Trappist? ‘<em>Brother, we must die</em>’—Nay,
‘<em>Brother, we are dead</em>’ would better suit our
case! No Cistercian wall could hold a drearier
prospect than this dismal town of Bruges.”</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and dragged himself with
slouching steps to the window:—</p>

<p>“Faugh! the smell of those dead waters—the
stillness of them!… I vow I can hear the
drip from yonder leafless poplars on the bank!
Aye, Charles is dead, and Bruges is his tomb! ’Tis
no lofty withdrawal from life, like his great namesake’s,
but a very sordid end, my good Harry.
Death of credit, death of hopes.… Here we
are, in a town of merchants, a community of buyers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and sellers, and we have not wherewithal to pay for
a supper, nay, not even for a bottle to help us forget
that we have not supped.”</p>

<p>The other man had risen in his turn and approached
the window.</p>

<p>“Why, now!” he cried, and his voice in its brisk,
manly tone formed a strong contrast to the other’s
melancholy drawl, “’tis surely but this pestilent fog
keeps Mr. Secretary Hyde and my lord of Bristol
from rejoining us with the promised supplies; faith,
and who knows? with news that may cheer our
hearts, my liege.”</p>

<p>“Harry,” said the other, wheeling round and facing
him with something of humour in his rueful visage,
“this <em>my liege</em> of yours to my empty stomach savours
most damnably of mockery. For love of Heaven,
if thou wouldst help me to bear it, remember
we are but comrades in bad straits together.
Here is poor Charles, and there stands poor
Harry. Liege? Majesty? Psho! Our own
country will have none of us; our friends abroad
have failed us; the wise burghers of this town will
no longer recognise the value of a signature of mine—and
as for thee.…”</p>

<p>“My last remittance, overdue this month; intercepted,
I make no doubt, by Old Noll’s—” Rockhurst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made a gesture toward the casement: yonder
to the north, but a score of miles, perhaps, Cromwell’s
well-found ships were cruising, as he knew, close in
shore. “Well, better luck next venture!” he went
on. “Our friends at home—the one certainty in
these uncertain times—do not forget us. Sighs!
Did I sigh? ’Twas at the thought that, though there
is still firewood in the house you deigned to honour
to-night, there is ne’er a bottle left for your Majesty’s
entertainment—and.…”</p>

<p>In eloquent conclusion, the Cavalier pulled out a
silk purse and crushed its emptiness between his
palms with a smile, which the anxious gaze he fixed
upon his visitor markedly belied.</p>

<p>“My last angel gone to the surly porter of Mynheer
Tratsaert’s house of business this afternoon.
I had better have kept it for our supper. But who
would have thought that Mr. Secretary Hyde, Councillor,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, would allow
such lack.…”</p>

<p>“And who would have thought who knew the
fortunes of Charles that he was ever destined to do
aught but lack? The fox hath his hole and the
birds of the air have nests … but Charles shall
not even have a stone whereon to lay his head.
Aye—you may well stare, Harry, to hear me quote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Scripture. The waters are at lowest ebb with us,
good friend; and like the rest of the world, in our
extremity, we turn to the texts.”</p>

<p>A moment the elder man stood gazing through the
gloom which in the falling firelight was gathering
ever more closely about them, at the face of his
royal master. Then he said in a low voice which
more concealed than betrayed emotion:—</p>

<p>“When the tide is at lowest, ’tis but nearest to the
turn.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” broke from the other with ever-increasing
bitterness, “if that is where thy hopes lie, I am sorry
for thee. There is no turn in such fortunes as mine,
but an ever-sapping drain. Why, there is not a
kinsman can afford to show countenance to such a
falling house, not a lady in Europe who has heart
enough to risk her fate with my hopes. Nay, there’s
not even a fat tallow merchant of Flanders who
thinks it worth his while to risk a present guilder
for future favour. You would do better, my
lord, to go seek your peace with the powers that be—and
for this you have recent high precedent—rather
than remain to share the last ruin of our
line.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” exclaimed Rockhurst then, “how shall
my house stand if yours fall? How shall my body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
keep health if yours ail? Where is my country but
with you, or my hopes but with yours?”</p>

<p>Charles answered the steady tones with an attempt
at lightness which failed to cover completely a certain
tender break in his own voice.</p>

<p>“The more fool you, then, Harry! Easy terms
would be made to the Viscount Rockhurst. He
could dwell on his fat lands once more in power and
opulence instead of wasting them in fines—he could
bring up his heir in leisure; nay, he could wed him a
new wife and beget him a fresh family, all in merry
England.”</p>

<p>“My son,” answered the other, “is in good hands—and
my sister in the farm-house where she hath
refuge brings him up even in such wise as I should
myself. As for a new wife, poor Charles,”—his lips
broke into a smile as they spoke the words,—“believe
your poor Harry, he is as little likely to seek one as he
is to seek a new master—But, Heaven forgive me!”
he went on with brisk change of tone, “this outer fog
seems to have befogged my inner wits. The house
can at least afford us lights. Nay, I will close the
casement upon the dull, wet world. Another log
or two on the hearth!” He added action to speech,
and a cheerful roar and blaze answered the ministration.
“The curtain across the casement—so!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Now we were in worse straits after Worcester.
Have you forgotten how we stole a sheep and killed
it and brought you the reeking leg, and you yourself
cut it into collops and set them in the pan? Good
lack—how tough they were! Yet ’twas a merry
supper. Back to your chair by the warmth, my
dearest Sire. An hour’s patience, and it will go ill
with me if I serve you not a meal—and wine to it—fit
wine for the pledge it shall wash.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and how will you manage that, my merry
Rockhurst?” asked Charles Stuart listlessly, as he
suffered himself to be led back to his chair.</p>

<p>“Why, by a fight or a kiss, a laugh or a lie!”
cried his companion gaily. “Since the French
king has thrust us out to please England’s Protector;
since the Don neglects to maintain us in proper
state, why then, the Don’s land must be made to
provide!” He took up his sword which lay on the
table to his hand and buckled it round his lean
figure as he spoke. “A joke will bring a man far
along sometimes; or, if not, then a prodigious bit
of deceit. I am ready, too, to kiss, my good liege,
or kill. Is not all fair in love and war? And
are we not at war still, aye, and with the whole
world too,—and as much in love as out of it?
There are women in this Flemish town, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have hearts for a man, or how could even this
Bruges subsist?”</p>

<p>He stood in the full light of the racing hearth-flame,
the points of the thin mustache quivering
with his smile. So handsome, although worn with
anxiety and privation; so tall and proper a man,
so dashing a presence in such tattered and faded
garb.</p>

<p>Charles turned his dark eyes slowly on his
friend.</p>

<p>“Art a likely figure, in verity, to go courting the
prude burgher’s daughter!” he drawled upon a
yawn. “Aye, well—off with thee, then, and I’ll
have a nap to pass the weary time. <i lang="fr">Qui dort dine</i>,
as the French say—though my sleek cousin of
France would scarce put up with the alternative!—But
mind how you play, my lord, with your kisses
and your blade—I can ill afford to lose my last
friend!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst answered but by a look of affectionate
devotion. Then, after a little pause:—</p>

<p>“I will send Chitterley with candles,” said he,
“and bid him lay the table against my return.”</p>

<p>Upon which, he made as low a bow toward the
languid figure as if the exile sat in state upon his
throne, and withdrew from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In the entrance-hall, dimly lit by a tallow candle
thrust in an iron sconce, he paused, and an air of
concentration succeeded the spurt of enforced gaiety.</p>

<p>Charles had indeed summed up the situation.
The English Royalists, bankrupt of credit, bankrupt
at last of hope, the King himself reduced to
pledge his orders, even his favourite silver-hilt
sword, the royal dinner “dwindled to one dish”;
withal the taste of wine like to some receding memory!
It would require an inspiration of audacity this
evening to provide the rashly promised guerdon.
But Rockhurst had a soul to which emergency was
a sure spur. He wasted no further time upon reflection,
since reflection served but to show ever more
sternly that in this night’s foray he must suffer chance
and his own boldness to guide him. Going to the
door of the servants’ quarters, he called for the
French factotum—a clever rascal, cook, valet,
groom,—who, with his faithful English attendant,
represented the household of the whilom sumptuous
Lord Viscount.</p>

<p>“Marcelin!”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur?” The word rang back in brisk
interrogation from the underground kitchen.</p>

<p>“Get thee a lantern and attend me. We go
foraging, you understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, monseigneur!” There was something
of a joyous ring in the prompt answer.</p>

<p>“Chitterley!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord!”</p>

<p>“His Majesty himself is with us to-night! Take
up candles and lay the supper table—”</p>

<p>“Yes—my lord.” The quavering response was
given in tones of doubt and wonder.</p>

<p>Rockhurst adjusted his cloak,—a garment more
weather-stained and damaged even than the suit
it covered,—flung upon his head the battered beaver
with its derision of a Cavalier plume, and was unlocking
the door when Marcelin emerged.</p>

<p>“I have taken the liberty to bring a basket,
monseigneur,” said the man, casting the object
(which was of bloated dimensions) on the floor whilst
he settled his lantern to better trim. “Foraging?—Good
news, my faith, for it’s a weary time since we
have had but Poor-John or a sandhill rabbit to our
stringy cabbage! Monseigneur has his plan, no
doubt?”</p>

<p>“None as yet,” said Rockhurst. “But, at
whatever cost, Marcelin, we return not here empty-handed.”</p>

<p>“As soon die of a knock on the head as of
famine,” said the Frenchman lightly. “Milord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hardly conceives with what joy I am of his enterprise.
I would follow milord at all times, but to-night
there is hardly a crime I do not feel capable of
after these days of stock-fish and clear water.”</p>

<p>The strokes of nine were falling slow and grave
from the Cathedral tower, somewhere high above
the fog, as they turned into the street. All Bruges,
wrapped in her blanket of mist, lay to their will: a
town asleep, or soon to be, for your Fleming is a
creature of early hours.</p>

<p>The hungry Cavalier had instinctively shaped his
course through the High Street toward the Grande
Place, in or about which purlieus lay the few taverns
that remained open during night hours—dismal
holes enough, which brought sighing remembrance
of jovial London meetings. But no hostelry good
or vile is a place of promise to him who, in the local
parlance, “lodge but the Devil in his purse.” And
much to Marcelin’s disappointment his lordship
passed pensively on to outlying districts. There was,
as he had admitted, as yet no definite plan in his
mind; but he sought those quarters of the town where
the evening fare was likely to be most succulent.
Was he not to cater for a king?</p>

<p>With one or two of the great houses which rose
on the quay of the Augustines, isolated from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
other by the length of high-walled gardens, he had
had in earlier and slightly more prosperous days
of exile a passing acquaintance. Had a forgotten
shutter, an undrawn curtain, but given him a glimpse
of some pleasantly lighted family repast, he would
have made bold to ply knocker and bell and demand
a loan, trusting to the hour of mellow conviviality
and his own winning address. But not even a ray
was suffered this night to send its cheerful message
into the street from those carefully barred balconies
and windows. The burgher filled himself from his
good fleshpots—the English exile or Spanish soldier
might roam, ragged and empty, in the cold.</p>

<p>“Has monseigneur any definite purpose in making
his promenade through the fog, which—saving
monseigneur’s respect—is as searching as the
devil? If I might venture to suggest,” murmured
Marcelin at last, in tones of apologetic weariness,
drawing close to Rockhurst’s elbow, “if monseigneur
would visit the Three Flags tavern, or the Cellar
at the Sluys Gate, he might perhaps deign to win
a few pistoles from some Spanish coronel or some
French gentleman prisoner on parole. Then—”</p>

<p>“Marcelin,” interrupted Rockhurst, “the lining
of our purse admits of no such suggestion, however
otherwise sagacious. Do not attempt to interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the guidance of fate. The night is foggy, ’tis
true; natheless is fog more substantial to take into
your empty carcass than mere airs. These houses
do not present a hospitable front, yet each one holds
gold both in purse and in flagon. The question is
how to get it. That question is fate’s business to
solve for us. March.”</p>

<p>He swung into as quick a pace as the uncertain
gloom and the rough pavement permitted; and, as
if his servant’s words had started it in his memory,
began to sing, not loudly, but in a voice of some
sweetness, the air of a swaggering popular Spanish
song that was much on the lips, this autumn, of Don
John’s soldiery.</p>

<p>Hardly had he reached the second stave when,
overhead, a window guarded with ornamental bowed
iron grille-work was cautiously opened, and a woman’s
voice took up the refrain as gently as a swallow
twitters.</p>

<p>Rockhurst instantly halted, and doffing his hat
with gallant alertness, glanced up at the square of
faint light, against which a woman’s head, leaning
forward behind the curving bars, was just visible.</p>

<p>“Hist—” The warning sound dropped sibilantly.</p>

<p>“Hist!” promptly responded Rockhurst, ready
for all emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Then through the bars a hand fluttered a second.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">La llave del jardin</i>,” breathed the timid tones,
in a Spanish which even his own foreign ear recognised
as more Flemish than Castilian. Upon which
something fell with a muffled clang at his feet: the
key of the garden door.</p>

<p>“My soul…!” responded Rockhurst in his
most ardent whisper.</p>

<p>His Spanish did not go very far; but he had at
least that nodding acquaintance with it which residence
in Flanders rendered necessary to a Cavalier.
Fortunately, more was not required of him; for the
house wall grew blank again with the closing window.</p>

<p>But fate had pointed her finger.</p>

<p>Stooping, he groped for the key. It was wrapped
in a fine kerchief which had a fragrance of angelic
water, and he sniffed with amused anticipation ere
he thrust it in his breast. He was weighing the heavy
key in his hand as Marcelin crept up to him again.</p>

<p>“If monseigneur had only deigned to inform me
that it was a rendezvous…!” he thought plaintively.
“Here am I very foolish, with my basket
instead of good cutlass to keep watch over his
<i lang="fr">bonne fortune</i>!”</p>

<p>The honest fellow’s head was in a complete whirl.
That milord should abandon the King for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of a lady was milord all over, it was true; nevertheless
an astounding proceeding, and milord’s manner
of conducting the affair confusing in the extreme.
But his master’s next words brought illumination:—</p>

<p>“Look you now, Marcelin, did I not tell you
Fortune would solve the riddle? Has she not
brought us to the most opulent house of the whole
row? And if it were not for the fog, her servant,
would that sweet lady have mistaken me for her
Spanish lover? Come, now, the garden door must
lurk in this wall to the right.”</p>

<p>He moved on a few steps, running his hand along
the brick. Marcelin followed, lost in admiration.</p>

<p>“Eh, by the little dog of St. Roch!” he cried,
“does monseigneur intend—?”</p>

<p>“Certes, my friend, and to make the lady glad
of the exchange,” answered the Cavalier in his quiet
voice. “Ha, here is the nail-studded wood: here
with your lantern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="KINGS_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">CAVALIER AND CAPITAN</span></h3>

<p>Even as he spoke, bending to look for the lock,
there came along the cobbles of the lane a clink of
spurs that rang to the rhythm of a martial tread.
And presently a rather husky voice was uplifted into
that same conquering lilt—the tune of the marching
Spaniards—that had come to Rockhurst’s mind a
few moments before.</p>

<p>Lilt and step fell into sudden silence at the corner
of the house. The newcomer had halted, apparently
struck by the sight of the two figures, shadowed as
they were through the vapours at the garden gate by
the lantern light. Rockhurst’s head as he bent over
the lock was lit up fantastically. The bold features,
the thin, upturned mustache, quivering now with a
mischievous smile, the peaked beard, black as
raven’s wing, and the hat with its challenging tilt
and its incredible plume, all seemed to proclaim
in him one of Don John’s own rakish soldiers of
fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The key turned in the lock. The next instant the
Capitan (the red plume sweeping over the hat-brim
proclaimed his rank) sprang forward with a
growl like an angry dog’s and plucked at Rockhurst’s
cloak, even as the latter was pushing the door open.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, comrade!” he whispered, “you are
caught at it—breaking into an honest burgher’s
house! Out of this, sharp!”</p>

<p>“Breaking in, camarado? Why, not at all,”
responded Rockhurst, in his own Franco-Spanish.
“Merely entering where I am expected, and my
servant there holds the light.—Come in, Marcelin.”</p>

<p>He stepped lightly through the doorway, leaving
his cloak in the other’s grasp. His voice, in the
undertone they both deemed prudent to adopt, yet
conveyed the perfection of mockery.</p>

<p>“Expected? <i lang="es">Cuerpo de Dios!</i>” said the gallant,
and fell back a step, blank surprise robbing him,
it seemed, of all other emotion for the present.</p>

<p>“Even so, Señor Caballero, witness this key.
(Up with the light, Marcelin, that the señor may see
for himself.) Witness the token.” He brandished
first the key, then the scented handkerchief, with
gay gesture. “May I trouble you for my cloak?
Then I shall wish you good night.”</p>

<p>Marcelin, grinning, stood between the two, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
back against the door-post, the basket on his arm,
holding up the lantern. The light fell full on the
Spaniard’s visage: young and handsome enough it
was, though now livid with fury. Still speechless, he
seemed rooted to the spot, his black eyes starting, the
wings of his nostrils distended upon his angry breath.</p>

<p>Rockhurst waited a second or two, then with a
laugh:—</p>

<p>“Marcelin,” he ordered, “relieve the noble Capitan
of my cloak: he will understand my impatience.”</p>

<p>The little valet, shifting the lantern into the basket,
put out his hand obediently for the ragged garment
in question. But here the newcomer, suddenly
leaping into active ferocity, made a headlong rush
into the garden, and had not Rockhurst by a dexterous
step aside avoided the onslaught, would have
seized his rival by the throat.</p>

<p>“Come in, Marcelin, and shut the door,” came the
mocking voice from the darkness. “Let us unravel
this little question of precedence in snug privacy.
We shall want your lantern, my friend.”</p>

<p>The garden, tree-shaded and high-walled on all
sides, seemed to shut in and concentrate the night’s
gloom. The sound of two swords, hissing out of
the scabbards even as the words were spoken, was
sinister in the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Rockhurst quickly drew once more within the
faint circle of light. The lantern held aloft (now
in a somewhat nervous clutch, it must be said)
revealed the silent laughter that rippled over his
features like wild-fire, as he flung himself into an
extravagantly truculent fencing attitude. The Spaniard,
stamping on the sod like a bull enraged, filled
the air with guttural execrations, while he swung
Rockhurst’s cloak in frantic circles over his left arm.
His rapier gleamed one moment aloft, then, low-aimed,
shot forward like a flash.</p>

<p>Marcelin involuntarily shouted warning; but
Rockhurst, with the coolness of the experienced fighting
man, had already slipped from the stroke of death
as airily as the practised dancer to the turn of the
tune. On the instant he had plucked his dilapidated
beaver from his head, and beating with it the menacing
blade widely aside, brought down his own steel
whistling upon the wrist that palely showed behind
the gilt Toledo hilt.</p>

<p>With a muffled scream of rage and pain the Spaniard
dropped his weapon, fell on one knee, feverishly
shaking the cloak off his arm to nurse his helpless,
bleeding hand.</p>

<p>Rockhurst’s skill, guided by luck, had inflicted,
at the first pass, one of those disabling wounds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cause pangs singularly disproportionate to their seriousness.
He sheathed his rapier with much deliberation,
picked up his cloak and flung it around him
as it were a royal mantle, smoothed out the feather
in his hat,—not improved in any way by its buckler
service,—and set it back on his head at the right
jaunty cock. He was about to pass the Capitan with
a taunting <i lang="es">buenas noches</i>, when some impulse of
careless good nature bade him change his mind.</p>

<p>“Nay, I am sure,” he said, “that our fair one
within will support my invitation when I bid you
to sup and converse. In your own Castilian phrase:
Will you not enter into this your house?—Marcelin,
support the Señor Capitan; he waxes, methinks,
somewhat weakly.”</p>

<p>And, upon a further spur of magnanimity, he
himself returned the fallen sword to the defeated
man’s side.</p>

<p>Faint chinks of light cut upon the darkness showed
them where the house door stood, slightly ajar,
upon the garden. And as the trio approached,
the feet of the wounded man shuffling along the
tiled path, the soft voice called out, in its broken
Spanish:—</p>

<p>“Señor Ramon, is that you?—For the love of
God, what has happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>He who was just adjured answered only by a
groan; whereupon Rockhurst, stepping up to the
chink and speaking in low but cheerful tones, addressed
the invisible lady in French this time:—</p>

<p>“Dear madam, if you will but admit us, you shall
have explanation. The Capitan Ramon has met
with a slight misadventure, and needs but your
smile, a bandage, and a tass of brandwein to restore
him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, heavens!” answered she, and the door was
flung wide open. A woman, evidently of the rich
burgher class, young, and very fair of colouring,
stood in the passage, a small lamp in her hand. Her
face blanched as the half-fainting man was assisted
across the threshold, and she caught her free hand
to her lips as if to stifle a rising scream. It was
evident, thought Rockhurst, that there were those
in the house whom she feared to disturb.</p>

<p>The danger of her own situation weighing apparently
upon her even more than the condition of her
lover, she gathered herself quickly together; and, imploring
caution by gesture, ran light-footed up the passage,
beckoning as she went. She thus inducted the
whole party into a panelled room, which seemed built
at the most distant end from the front. It was gaily
lighted by a hanging crown of candles, warmed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
stove, furnished in brown oak, with dressers and
shelves upon which gleamed much pewter and brass
of high polish. Upon a table covered with fair red
and white napery stood revealed an unmistakable
supper for two, with abundance of good things, at
sight of which Rockhurst and Marcelin exchanged
a deep glance of meaning.</p>

<p>As she closed the door upon their entrance, the
young woman drew a deep breath of relief, exclaiming
in her Flemish French:—</p>

<p>“Here we are safe!—In the passage,” she added,
turning to Rockhurst, “the servants, sir, might have
heard us from their quarters.”</p>

<p>The simple air with which she spoke, the round
blue eyes she fixed upon them, the practical candour
with which she excused herself for a seeming want
of hospitality before attending to her groaning
lover, gave Rockhurst swift insight into the nature
they had to deal with. Here was a matter-of-fact
young vrow, not even pretty,—at least to a fastidious
English eye—for, with her little moon
face and her hemp-coloured hair, she might have
emerged from a canvas by Master Gerard Dow,
yet with much that was agreeable about her manner,
about the gentle irregularity of her features, but
above all about her engaging youthfulness. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
certainly was none of your vaporous dames. She
showed no undue emotion at sight of the Spaniard’s
blood-dyed hands; but, as she turned to help him,
was neatly careful to twitch her dress from too close
proximity and to push her lace cuffs higher up her
plump arms.</p>

<p>After examining the gash with crooning sympathy,
she poured water into one of the bright pewter
dishes that stood on the sideboard; then, cutting
a napkin into strips with the carving-knife,
addressed the Cavalier:—</p>

<p>“If you will kindly give him the brandwein—it
is in the square glass bottle beside the pasty.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst started from his amused contemplation
and turned to the damaged gallant. This
latter, installed by Marcelin with mock solicitude
in a chair near the table, sat collapsed, with his head
on his breast. Rockhurst conceived a shrewd
suspicion that the Capitan’s prolonged weakness
was more feint than reality, an opinion apparently
shared by the servant, whose face was wreathed in
satiric smiles. And when the wounded man pettishly
pushed aside the brandy and demanded <i lang="es">del
vino</i>, the doubt became certainty.</p>

<p>“Wine, Marcelin,” ordered the Cavalier briefly,
as one in his own house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>After having drained a rummer of Rhenish, the
Capitan recovered sufficiently to roll his head toward
his lady as she knelt on his right, laving the languid,
bleeding hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, traitress!” he observed scathingly.</p>

<p>“Madam,” interjected Rockhurst, as the pale
blue eyes were raised in wonder from their task,
“your valiant friend refers, I imagine, to your having
honoured me with a song, an invitation, a token, and
a key. It is because of his failure to understand
the right of a lady to dispose of all favours at her
will that he met with the little accident to which he
now owes the honour and the joy of your sweet
ministration.”</p>

<p>“Sir…!” cried Ramon the Capitan, lifting
his olive-hued countenance to fling an uncertain
glare across the table. Then, no fresh argument
apparently occurring to him, he repeated resentfully,
“Traitress—traitress!”</p>

<p>“In heaven’s name,” she cried, pausing in her
task, “was it not you?—How, sir, was it you?”</p>

<p>She turned her childish gaze from one to the
other, her blond head, as she knelt, just emerging
above the table. For all answer, Rockhurst drew
key and kerchief from his breast and pushed them
toward her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniard drew breath for a fresh compliment.
But, Marcelin putting a second glass opportunely
to his hand, he plunged his mustache again
into the wine.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a mistake!” murmured the vrow,
returning placidly to her ministrations. “Alas,
what a cut!—it must be tended by the surgeon,
but I will draw the lips together and bandage.
You can give yourself time for supper first.”</p>

<p>She wound the strips firmly as she spoke, though
the patient spluttered in his cup, winced, and whistled.
To complete the artistic effect she took the
handkerchief that lay on the table and tied it neatly
over all. Rockhurst was shaken with his silent
laughter over the singular pair of lovers.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the little hostess, rising to her feet
and addressing him, then, not without dignity:
“I know not whom you may be, but your presence
here is the result of a misunderstanding. That
you may not misunderstand further, let me inform
you that I receive the Capitan Ramon at this hour
only because my husband, who went off to-day to
Antwerp, has forbidden him to enter his house.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Rockhurst, as he rose in his
turn and bowed, concealing under an air of preternatural
gravity his delight at the simple statement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
“had I the honour of standing in your husband’s
shoes, I should be jealous of every dog that looked
at you.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” she exclaimed, her gaze widening
upon him, “but my husband is old and fat.”</p>

<p>The hard brilliancy of the Cavalier’s eye softened:
here was a remark which betrayed the logic of a
perfectly childish mind.</p>

<p>“The poor Capitan Ramon,” she went on, “has
so little money and gets such poor fare. I think it
but right to help him.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Rockhurst, “you have described
my own case. I bless the hour when I was inspired
to pass beneath the window of so tender-hearted a
lady!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” she said, and her creamy skin flushed
to the roots of her hair, “if you will share the supper,
too, I shall be glad of it.”</p>

<p>Again the Spaniard rolled his glare of sullen doubt.
Rockhurst had not lived the life of camps for so
many years without becoming familiar with every
variety of your <i lang="es">soldado</i>. He was able, by this time,
to read very clearly that here was but one of those
ubiquitous “officers of fortune” who, behind a
punctilious manner and a conquering exterior,
screen anything but a chivalric soul—mercenaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who, no doubt, will fight when occasion is imperative,
but who reckon upon looks as much as upon
“derring-do” for the securing of this world’s comforts.
The attack in the garden, under the spur of
sudden fury, upon the invader of his own conquered
province, had exhausted the Capitan’s pugnacity:
Rockhurst saw that, in the further progress of the
night’s adventure, this Ramon need no longer be
taken into account.</p>

<p>“I should be churl, indeed,” said he to the lady,
as he sat down at the table, “to decline your gracious
courtesy. Nay, madam, pray take your seat; my
servant will even pass the dishes. Natheless, if
you will so honour me, a glass of wine from your
fair hand?… I give you thanks.—Marcelin,
you can feed the Señor Capitan.”</p>

<p class="tb">So the odd supper party began; the hostess unconsciously
admiring; the Spaniard all a-frown;
Rockhurst rattling his compliments with fascinating
courtliness—his heart the while in the bare lodgings
of the Quai Vert with his unprovided King;
his brain intent upon turning the tide of events to
the channels of his own purpose. He could see
nothing thus far, but to await the moment when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Spaniard, sufficiently fuddled with wine after his
blood-letting, might be conveyed back to the street
by Marcelin and handed over to the next patrol.
Then, thought Rockhurst, the gentle vrow would
be left to the unhampered diplomacy of her uninvited
guest (who felt prepared to wield it as profitably,
and justify it as gallantly, as any Castilian
in Bruges), and all would be plain sailing.</p>

<p>The astute valet seemed to have divined the
scheme, and was plying the bottle sedulously upon
his charge. Fate, however, upon which the wanderers
had hitherto so blindly reckoned, again wielded
the key.</p>

<p>Marcelin had hardly drawn the first sweep of
the knife upon the goose’s breast when the house
reverberated to the sound of distant knocking.
The little dame went as white as the kerchief at her
bosom; a far greater discomfiture fell upon her than
she had manifested at sight of her gallant’s
wound.</p>

<p>“Heaven’s mercy!” she gasped; “it is from the
street!”</p>

<p>She ran to the inner door and listened in the
passage; the knocking was resumed, from no patient
or weakling hand, in peculiar cadence.</p>

<p>“It is my husband,” she said then, coming back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
into the room, with the calmness of despair. “It
is my husband, and I am lost.”</p>

<p>The Spaniard rose to his feet and stood swaying,
a look of dismay and helplessness upon his countenance.
Instinctively she turned to Rockhurst,
and pointing to the sorry figure, she cried:—</p>

<p>“My husband will never forgive me … no,
Josse will never forgive me! He bought Ramon
out when they had billeted him on us, last month.
He bought him out and I was forbidden ever to
speak to him again. I thought I was safe to-night …
I am lost!”</p>

<p>The thunder of the husband’s rapping accompanied
her lament with swelling rhythm.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she went on, “Josse told me this morning
he was going to Antwerp. It was a trap!”</p>

<p>“A trap!” exclaimed the Cavalier gaily. “But
there is a way out, madam, a way out, since there
was a way in!”</p>

<p>“To the devil with this night’s work!” suddenly
gurgled the Capitan. “To the devil, say I, with
women and fools!”</p>

<p>His lady’s wine had not been without effect upon
his wits; but he was sober enough to seize the situation
and act on his rival’s hint. In three staggering
steps he was at the door, and they could hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
him break into a kind of groping run down the
passage.</p>

<p>In the midst of her terror the Dutchwoman’s
eye flashed with sudden scorn.</p>

<p>“Truly,” said Rockhurst, as if in answer, “’tis
a valiant heart! Yet, madam, with him is your
chief anxiety removed. Whilst you play with
bolts and delay your lord with fond embrace, we,
on our side, vanish by the garden whence we came.
Aye, and let out the señor, for ’tis still I who have
the key.—Go, dear madam; leave the rest to
us.”</p>

<p>“Alack, alack!” she moaned, “this supper table,
laid for two, will yet betray me!”</p>

<p>“Say you so!” exclaimed Rockhurst, his wits
leaping to the humorous opportunity. “Nay,
then shall the supper vanish, too! Your Flemish
household still sleeps heavily; our chances are
good. Madam, before you hurry to the door, you
had better put some dishevelment in your attire
to show you had but just descended from your
bedchamber, where you were doubtless already
disrobing.—Marcelin, you rogue, you have a
reputation for a smart table servant; deserve it!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the hurried words, he had begun
himself to toss goose and pasty into the basket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to stuff a brace of the long flagons securely in the
interstices.</p>

<p>There was a stir overhead; the household was
awaking.</p>

<p>“Monseigneur,” cried Marcelin, on an inspiration,
“no time for niceties! If monseigneur will
take one end of the cloth, I will take the other.
We can carry the victualling wholesale into the
garden and there advise about packing—Madam
will see to the bloody basin, no doubt?”</p>

<p>Upon these words, with all presence of mind, the
valet ransacked the dresser of everything it bore in
the shape of good cheer, cakes and ham, brawn and
an eel pie, and many flagons (not forgetting the
square-faced bottle), and made a pile of the booty
upon the table.</p>

<p>Obedient to his suggestion, the hostess had tripped
out to fling the contents of the basin upon a flower
bed. She came back in a trice, found Marcelin
already loaded with the weighty, strangely bulging
bag, and with fervent words of thanks held the
door open for him. Rockhurst meanwhile was gaily
blowing out candle after candle of the hanging crown.
Ponderous footsteps descending the stairs proclaimed
that the porter was at length aroused.</p>

<p>“One light for you, madam,” said Rockhurst;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“you are just in time!” He thrust the last unextinguished
taper into her hand; then, his arm
round her waist, bending his height to her small
stature, drew her toward the door: “Good-by,”
he said, “sweet hostess. Another time choose
more wisely both your hour and your cavalier.”</p>

<p>She turned her soft, childish face with a little sob up
toward him. And with a sudden stirring of the heart,
as toward a winsome child, he bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget how you have saved me, this
night!” she said, her lips upon his. At which Rockhurst
kissed her again to conceal his amusement.</p>

<p>The sound of a bar grating reluctantly in its socket
rang the urgency of parting. Yet, she clutched him.</p>

<p>“You said you were poor and hungry, like him
… like him who fled,” she panted. “I had saved
this for him: I had rather you had it.”</p>

<p>She thrust a small velvet bag into his hand, one
second more pressed clingingly against him, and the
next instant was flying light-footed away. There
came a sound of a growling voice; at which Rockhurst
in all celerity flung his cloak over his shoulders
and withdrew, closing the outer door noiselessly
behind him. Marcelin’s lantern flashed one ray
of guidance: yonder the gate and the end of the
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The three emerged into the street. Rockhurst
paused, his silent laughter stimulated afresh at sight
of Marcelin, who stood doubled in two under the burden
of the great white bag, his basket with the two
bottle necks protruding, horn-like, on his arm, and his
lantern illumining a grin of supreme satisfaction.
Then he glanced down at the purse in his hand—it
lay in the hollow with a highly comforting weight—and
from thence to the Spaniard, who had begun to
crawl away, supporting himself against the wall.</p>

<p>“Señor Capitan,” he cried ironically after him,
“I wish you once more, and I trust finally, a very
good night!—Marcelin, I’ll take that basket: we
must make good speed.”</p>

<p>He halted, however, yet a breathing space to gaze
at the great front of the house where, from window
to window, gleamed a light on its upward way,
suggestive of a bed-going procession.</p>

<p>“This is how we live at Bruges!” he murmured to
himself, dropped the purse philosophically into his
pocket, thrust his right arm through the basket and,
his hand pressing on his rapier hilt, the tip of the
scabbard jauntily raising the cloak behind him,
started off at a swing.</p>

<p>Marcelin followed at a gay if uneven hobble,
occasionally staggering under his succulent burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Chitterley opened the door to his master.</p>

<p>“His Majesty sleeps,” said he, finger on lips; “I
looked in but just now, to place a log on the fire: his
Majesty slumbered very sound, as I heard and saw.”</p>

<p>Then the speaker’s eye wandered to the basket
on his lordship’s arm, the contents of which were
agreeably discernible, and to the improvised sack on
Marcelin’s back, for which the latter’s jubilant face
was warrant.</p>

<p>“Heaven be praised, my lord!” he exclaimed
fervently, as he extended his hand to relieve his
master. The tragedy of events had robbed the old
servant of all sense of humour. “His Majesty shall
have supper to-night; our house is not disgraced.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the Cavalier cheerfully, tapping his
breast; “and I have here the wherewithal for many
more, an I am not mistaken. See, Chitterley,
since his Majesty sleepeth so fast, an you can spread
the fare without awakening him, so that he may
open his eyes upon a pleasant sight. There has been
but little pleasantness for the royal glance of late.”</p>

<p>“I will step like a cat, monseigneur,” said Marcelin,
quicker to seize the idea than his English
comrade.</p>

<p class="tb">Whether Charles found it not worth while to rouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
himself from the only condition in which he could
forget his dismal state, or whether indeed the servants
had carried out their task with true noiselessness,
he stirred not in his great chair by the fire until
Rockhurst, stepping up to him gently, laid on his
lap the velvet bag with its snug weight of coin. Then
he opened a lazy eye while, instinctively, his long
hand closed upon the purse.</p>

<p>The King stared a moment vacantly at his devoted
follower, and with a stupendous yawn let his gaze
wander round the room.</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish!” he cried, critically weighing the bag;
“a purse, my lord, as we live! And a fuller than
these fingers have held for many a week!—Am I
dreaming, or am I but just awakened from some
monstrous nightmare of years? Is this St. Germain
once again?—or has fate worked with us benignly
while we slept, and is this Whitehall at last?…
Why, my merry Rockhurst, this is never a goose I
behold, on a Bruges table, flanked by pasty and
brawn! Hath our uncle of Spain paid our pension
at length—or has our Chancellor of the Exchequer
chanced at last upon an Exchequer to draw upon?—Harry,
dost thou actually hold in thy hand a brimming
goblet? Aye, methinks the fragrance of it
already reaches me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He broke off his bantering tone to add, as he
dropped the purse carelessly into his pocket and extended
his hand for the glass:—</p>

<p>“Nay, but, prince of friends, how have such miracles
been worked?”</p>

<p>“My liege,” said Rockhurst, with unmoved
gravity, “even as I ventured to prophesy: by a
laugh, a lie, a fight, a kiss. The fight came first and
the kiss came last—and the lie, I’ll warrant, is
even now being expounded within the house of a
certain mynheer of this town. As for the laugh,
your Majesty, nay, the laugh will be between you
and me anon when I tell you the tale.… But,
Chitterley, bring me a glass of wine.”</p>

<p>Charles, his merriment stayed on his lips by the
look of sudden emotion he marked on his host’s
face, gazed wonderingly up at him.</p>

<p>Rockhurst took the glass, and dropping on one
knee:—</p>

<p>“I pledge the future!” he murmured. “I drink
to the hope of England, to your Majesty’s happy
restoration, to the triumph of his cause—<i lang="es">Sursum
corda!</i>… my beloved liege!”</p>

<h2>FARRANT CHACE</h2>

<h3 id="FARRANT_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">FARRANT CHACE</span></h3>

<p>Storm without; and within, melancholy humours!—Without,
fine, blinding, dry snow, driven
in eddies against whatever obstacle it met: against
the walls of Sir Paul Farrant’s Manor House:
against the holly and clipped yews of his garden:
against the serried ranks of firs which screened his
estate from the wild blasts that ride from the Downs
up the great rise of Hindhead. Never more wildly,
never more triumphantly, did the winds ride than
on this night of the winter solstice, this Christmas
Eve, the fifth since the happy date of his Most
Gracious Majesty’s Restoration.</p>

<p>Within, a fire of logs glowing under the huge
mantelled chimney; rosy flicker on wainscot,
glitter of crystal and silver on fair white napery, and
a full-paunched bottle or two, dusty and cobwebbed;
crocus flames of candles against the rose of the
hearth-light and the brown of the oak. Cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enough surroundings, one would have deemed—a
sort of room where a man might hug comfort
with philosophic egotism and have the greater zest
in it for the thought of the outside desolation; sip
his glass to the tune of the wind; and toast his legs
in luxury as he pictured to himself the circumstance
of any poor devil who, upon such a night, still
chanced to be on the road.</p>

<p>Yet, as it has been said, the temper that reigned
within the oak parlour of Farrant Chace was no
whit more cheerful than the weather on the moor.
Indeed, my lord Viscount Rockhurst—on his
way back from France, obliged to halt by stress of
weather at the house of a fellow-traveller—looked
more particularly disqualified than usual to wear
the nickname bestowed upon him by the “merry
Monarch” himself in mockery of his wild favourite’s
invariable gravity. “Merry Rockhurst”—never
less merry of aspect than to-night.</p>

<p>His long legs extended toward the embers, he
lay rather than sat in the straight-backed chair of
honour beside the hearth. His head with its chiselled
features, worn, keen, witty, was sunken on his
breast; his eyes were fixed abstractedly upon the
darting flame, his hands inertly folded. For some
ten minutes he had not uttered a word or altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his attitude, and the silent immobility of his guest
was beginning to tell heavily upon the nerves of
Sir Paul Farrant, his young host.</p>

<p>Sir Paul bit his lip, paced the room three or four
times; then halted before the card-table, which
stood askew against the wall, as if it had been thrust
aside by an impatient hand. He took up the dice-box,
dangled it, dropped it; flipped a few of the scattered
cards, his eyes ever wandering back to his
companion; a hesitating phrase, ever checked upon
his lips. Now he went to the window, pulled the
curtains aside and peered forth.</p>

<p>“More snow—more snow! Ugh, ’tis plaguey
cold!” he cried, with exaggerated airiness, returning
to the hearth and spreading his hands to the
blaze.</p>

<p>“The drifts are rising higher and higher,” he
pursued. “No hope for the road, ’tis not fit weather
for a dog.”</p>

<p>The figure in the great chair stirred, a lazy voice
was raised:—</p>

<p>“Certainly not weather for a gentleman.”</p>

<p>The other leaped to the symptom of restored
companionship.</p>

<p>“As you say, my lord, very vile weather indeed.
Not fit for us to travel in, for very truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Rockhurst’s long eyelids flickered.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, with marked deliberation, his gaze
still fixed on the fire, “I spoke in the singular.”</p>

<p>Sir Paul’s hand, still stretched toward the glow,
suddenly trembled. He had a young, smooth face,
transparent to emotion; it grew scarlet.</p>

<p>“And what might your lordship mean by that?”
he asked, breathing quicker.</p>

<p>Lord Rockhurst shifted his person to a more
erect attitude, and turned his satiric face toward
the speaker. The elder by some fifteen years, he
had none of the genial gleam in his eye, none of
the something almost fatherly with which the mature
man of kindly mettle regards youth.—Lord Rockhurst’s
gaze was colder than the wind that whistled
in the leaves, bleaker than the moorland waste.</p>

<p>“I do not desire to qualify you,” said he.</p>

<p>From its uneasy flush, the young face went white.</p>

<p>“My lord, my lord!…”</p>

<p>But Rockhurst raised his hand with a commanding
gesture.</p>

<p>“When a man enters upon a game of hazard with
another, ’tis the very essence of honour that the
chances should be equal between them. Now,
my most excellent young host, had you played me
with loaded dice to-night—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The other broke out foaming at the mouth, with
the acrid rage of the helplessly insulted.</p>

<p>“My lord Rockhurst—! I will suffer no man,
nay, not even under my own roof, to dare such an
insinuation. The dice, my lord—”</p>

<p>He made a frantic gesture toward the card-table.
But, like the play of water upon red iron, Rockhurst’s
cool voice fell upon his heat:—</p>

<p>“Nay—the dice are right enough—so are the
cards. We were but us two, moreover, so you had
no accomplice. These are the elements of honest
play, as I was about to expound to you—since,
indeed, your father’s only son, and a lad of your
experience in court and camp, appears to require
such expounding.”</p>

<p>He changed his tone for one more subtly keen, as
the surgeon his blade at the delicate moment:
“But another element in play, between gentlemen,
is that one player should not stake against the other
sums he does not possess.”</p>

<p>Farrant, wincing, ran his hands desperately
through his fair locks; he fell into an arm-chair and,
still clutching his love curls, drew them across his
face. From behind this screen, after a long pause,
he spoke muffled words:—</p>

<p>“Your lordship seems to forget the circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
To help your lordship to pass this time of tedium
(since no horses that ever were foaled could take
your coach on through these snows); having the
responsibility of entertaining your lordship …
since you can find little pleasure but in the cards
… and having, in these cursed twenty-four
hours, lost every stiver of money, every rood of the
poor land I possess … zounds! my lord, that
I should have risked a few more throws with
nought but my ruin to back them … damnation,
my lord Rockhurst, since but a turn of the
dice might have set us even again!—these are hard
words, it seemeth to me! Aye, and hard thoughts.”</p>

<p>Thus set forth, his own case seemed to the youth
so strong that he lifted his head again and displayed
his countenance as wrathful and full of reproach
now as, a minute ago, it had been shamed.</p>

<p>Lord Rockhurst crossed one lean leg over the other,
settled his elbows at the most comfortable angle
the carven arms of the chair would afford, and let
his brilliant hazel eye wander to the red embers
and become dreamy once more.</p>

<p class="tb">For a long while silence reigned again in the oak
parlour of Farrant Chace.</p>

<p>A resinous knot in the pine log exploded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
miniature fierceness—a white flame jetted out,
hissing, and dropped. The fire settled itself and
the ashes slipped away, sighing. In the tense
silence these small sounds made emphasis; while
without, ever and anon, the blast came rolling up the
slope from the far distance, dashed through the
frantic swaying firs with screams of triumph, to hurl
itself against the sturdy walls, there to break and
part on either side and dash onward once more.</p>

<p>… So comes the charge of horse against the solid
mass of foot with ever-gathering speed, rider and
beast together, in one frenzied impetus, to break
themselves against the serried pikes.…</p>

<p class="tb">“Your father fell beside me at Naseby,” said
Rockhurst presently, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>The incisive note had vanished from his voice.
Farrant rose from the table and came towards him,
with something of the schoolboy’s mien, who half
resents his master’s anger and half hopes to see him
mollified. Rockhurst went on musingly:—</p>

<p>“He and I were neck and neck through Edgehill,
Newbury, Marston Moor.… Until that hour
I was young, younger than you are. And in those
days I had mighty thoughts. But in my mightiest
I never saw myself reaching to his level. If I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but keep my nag’s head close to his, and go where
he led, leap where he leaped—’twas enough for
me.… When he fell, struck down by Ireton’s
pikes, I thought the world grew dark.…
Then I was young, Master Paul. And now, sitting
in this chair to-night”—Rockhurst slowly straightened
himself and turned his head toward Farrant—“I
find there is still something left in me of the old
self that I had deemed to be dead this many a year.
Enough to be glad to-night, sir, that your father is
dead.—Paul Farrant,” went on the elder slowly,
“speak: had the luck turned as you hoped, upon what
foundation would you have built your winnings?”</p>

<p>The other hesitated, stammered, made a fresh
abortive effort to brazen it out.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord, the world hardly knows you so
squeamish. If such rigid rules obtained at Whitehall
we should be a dull lot, and many a merry
hour lost. Did your lordship say you had charged
Ireton’s men? By those tenets we might have
dreamed that your place had rather been among
the precisians.…”</p>

<p>A subtle change swept over Rockhurst’s countenance.
The air of grave severity, the shadow of
regretful tenderness, passed from him, to be replaced
by the mocking glance, the expression at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
once reckless and cynical which, before the world’s
eyes, characterised the man who had won for himself—among
a company of reprobates—that second
if scarcely more appropriate nickname of his,
“Rakehell Rockhurst.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but you’re a promising lad!” said he,
gibing. “And you’ll make your way, my son, I
doubt me not. Time advances, old types die out,
and manners change. The rules of honour which
still shackle old fools like myself would chafe your
gallant spirits.… Yet, hark ye, without being
a precisian, Master Paul, in my day, a man—a
gentleman—would no more have staked what he
did not possess, would no more have dallied with the
thought of selling a friend, than he would have forced
a lady. But, sure, what dull fellows are we of the
old days by the side of such sparks, such knights as
yourself! Meanwhile,” and here a wide and uncontrolled
yawn showed teeth as white as a wolf’s,
“meanwhile, excellent young man, I have here in
my pocket your signature to so much waste paper—I
have it as a memento of a series of tedious
games, a reminder of the prospect of another evening,
with your company, for all delectation.—Gadzooks,
sir, a man does not invite another to his
house, in a snow-storm, if there is a tolerable inn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
at hand, when he, being himself green as a March
lamb, has only a housekeeper old as sin!…
The Gods preserve me from the green man and the
withered woman! Add to this a cellar reduced to thin
Rhenish and claret—a cellar no sane man could
get drunk on, sir, and Christmastide!” Eye and
voice became even more insolently provocative. “I
have known many a one spitted for less provocation.”</p>

<p>“Would your lordship find some solace in having
a try for my vitals?” cried the youthful host eagerly.
His lip trembled; tears of mortification were
not far from his eyes. The fleer at his dull entertainment
cut him more keenly than the rebuke touching
the honour of his play. He already saw himself
held up to the ridicule of the Court by the Rakehell’s
unsparing tongue.—Gad, his old housekeeper!
his doubtful cellar! He, who had worked
so hard to achieve a position of fashion and gallantry,
who had plumed himself upon the distinction of
playing the host to so high a courtier as Viscount
Rockhurst, Lord Constable of the Tower—the
King’s own close friend!… He flung his
arm toward the swords that hung fraternally on the
wall, side by side, in their royal crimson baldricks.</p>

<p>But Rockhurst’s laugh, low-pitched, arrested all
further movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, good Sir Paul, I pray you! However you
may relish the idea of spilling the blood of your
guest, your guest cannot so far forget the rules of
gentle behaviour as to cross swords with his host.
Secondly, sir, you appear still to have to learn that a
man may not fight with one to whom he owes money.
And thirdly, now: when I had slain you, think you
that your corpse would be more amusing than your
live body?… Though, truth, it could scarce
be less so.”</p>

<p>He laughed again, through his teeth, at his own
gibe.</p>

<p>The boy, bated to desperation, stood clenching
and unclenching his hands, fighting back the furious
tears. The other, his back to the flames, stood
looking at him some time in silence. Then, into his
pitiless hawk’s eye came a gleam of humour—a
slight softening of compassion, perhaps. The mind
that once yields to humour can rarely continue to
entertain the deadly earnestness of anger. Rockhurst
yawned again, drew some crumpled sheets
from his pocket and flung them on the table.</p>

<p>“Now, look you, Sir Paul,” said he, good-naturedly,
“I care not for this mood. Devise me
but something of an entertainment for this evening—an
entertainment, mind you, that shall honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
entertain me—why then, I’ll stake again; I’ll stake
these, which represent your indebtedness to me,
against your inventiveness. Shorten but a couple of
hours for me, and I’ll shorten my memory of this
night’s business. Zounds, never stare so! Do
you not understand? ’Tis your wit for your honour—and
the chance of a lifetime to prove yourself
a man of resource!”</p>

<p>For an instant Paul Farrant’s countenance became
illumined; he made a hasty step forward.
Then he hesitated, and, in renewed dismay, put his
hand to his forehead. In the middle of the snow-drift,
with a condemned cellar and an ugly housekeeper,
debarred from gambling, debarred from
fighting, his brain paralysed by a crushing sense of
failure and folly—to devise amusement for this
fastidious, caustic nobleman, what a task!</p>

<p>He moved to the window, in reality more to hide
his fresh mortification than to examine the prospect
of the weather. It was to find that there was a lull
in the snowfall, that the wind had rent a gap between
the brooding clouds and revealed a patch
of starry sky ridden by the sickle of a young moon.
Through the swaying trees gleamed fitfully a distant
red fire, and beyond it, further down the waste,
a steadier yellow light came and went, as the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bowed and released some plumy fir branch: the
iron-smelting forge of the Hammer Pond! The
inn at Liphook! Now, he remembered him, the
smelter was a man of infinite popularity, the jester
of the countryside; one who could sing a rousing
stave to the clank of his hammer, and crack you
the drollest stories over the home-brewed, were it
only strong enough. Failing him, there was the
innkeeper of the Anchor, at Liphook. Mine host
had the secret of a noted posset that his Majesty
himself, halting on the Portsmouth Road, had
once generously praised. Nay, at the inn he might
possibly pick up some belated traveller, whose
conversation—he bitterly thought—would prove
more acceptable than his own. At any rate, ’twas
all the hope he had to cling to. Rockhurst never
spared.</p>

<p>“If your lordship will give me <i lang="fr">congé</i> for a short
while,” he cried, turning back to the room, “I
shall endeavour to meet your wishes.… We
may not be so destitute of entertaining company at
Farrant Chace as your lordship deems.”</p>

<p>He seized his cloak, flung it angrily about him,
goaded by the sound of the faint laugh, and strode
out. Rockhurst subsided into the chair, laughed a
little yet, then sighed and fell a-brooding again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="FARRANT_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LADY IN THE SNOW</span></h3>

<p>The lull after the squall had left a waste world,
dim yet white, beneath a cloud-strewn sky. High
among the clouds the wind was still racing; and
the aspect of the heavens was perpetually changing,
as masses of vapour rose and scuttled before the
blast like giant herds: rent apart, drawing closer, scattered
again. Thus the land was a-flicker with shine
and shadows, and yet lay dead under that semblance
of life.</p>

<p>Paul Farrant, astride the old farm mare, had no
thought to spare for the new appearance of the white
wilderness; scarce even a feeling for the biting cold.
His brain was all astir with vivid, angry images.
His pulses throbbed with the excitement of the gambler
playing for the highest stakes a man can win
or lose.</p>

<p>“’Tis now your wit against your honour,” had
said the Rakehell.</p>

<p>His honour! It had never been to Farrant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thing dearer than his own soul, which to lose, even
to his own secret knowledge, were damnation. To
know himself dishonoured meant to him merely
disgrace if he could not save himself by his wit.
Yet disgrace spelt the most unendurable fate that
could overtake one in whose nature vanity played
the chief part. And if he failed to fulfil the condition
so contemptuously placed upon his worldly
redemption, he knew his Rockhurst—all was over
for Farrant the aspiring; for Farrant, who was
already beginning to be envied; for Farrant, who
had once sat at the King’s supper-table and had
actually been honoured by a quip from his Majesty’s
own lips!…</p>

<p>Drooping her great head, drawing her shaggy
feet from the snow with dull, sucking sounds, the
mare plodded on her way. He did not attempt to
guide her, and she took him soberly to the highroad,
then turned toward the downward slope leading to
the village. On one side a black line of hedge ran
in and out like a ribbon; on the other all barrier
had disappeared under the drifting snow. Below the
turn of the road was the smelter’s forge, redly aglow
in the distance; and, something like a mile further,
the village where the noted posset might even now
be brewing; where comforted travellers, stamping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the snow from their boots, might be capping each
other’s tales of road hardships and perils. On the
sturdy mare, Paul Farrant had no doubt he could
reach the further goal; yet he hesitated. The plan
which had driven him out into the night suddenly
appeared to him ineffable folly. A paralysing
vision arose before him: Rockhurst’s countenance
at sight of Master Smelter, with the black fists, as
the proposed evening comrade!… He could
see the dilation of the nostrils, the haughty lips,
barely apart upon a smile. What a tale would not
Rockhurst’s tongue make of it for royal ears!—As
for the inn, were he to find there some chance
gentlefolk, how could he hope to induce them to
come forth again on such a night, when, in truth,
no coach was like to find a passage through the snow?</p>

<p class="tb">Through the great silence a distant cry pierced
into his consciousness. Heard at first vaguely, it
fell in with his thought: the note, it seemed, of his
own distress. But in a moment it was repeated,
higher, clearer, an unmistakable call for help.</p>

<p>He was in the mood to be swayed by the first
impulse, to take the toss of fate. His was not the
nature to turn out of its way to assist the afflicted;
but now he wheeled the mare round and drove her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
up the hill, fiercely, as if his own deliverance, not
that of some fellow-creature, was at stake. And,
in truth, who shall say that it was not?</p>

<p>On the edge of the road, at its abrupt twist down
the hill, stood the black bulk of a coach, horseless,
crookedly embedded in the snow. It told its own
tale. As he drew nearer, a cloaked figure staggered
toward him and almost fell against his steed’s
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, do not pass; do not go by!” moaned a
woman’s voice. “I am dying of the cold!”</p>

<p>She lifted her face. The faint light of the rifted
sky, given back intensified by the white world, had
a luminosity of its own in which most things were
strangely visible. Paul Farrant saw that the woman
who clutched at his reins was young and fair-favoured.
He stared a moment in mere astonishment. Then
a thought, devilish, acute, exultant, leaped into his
brain.—There was his ransom!</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, bending down over his
horse’s neck and peering close into her face, “I
am fortunate in having heard you. Are you indeed
alone?”</p>

<p>“Alone, yes,” she answered through chattering
teeth; “the servants rode away for help, God
knows how long ago.… Perchance they are lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in the snow, dead, somewhere. Indeed, with this
cold, I shall soon be dead, too!”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, you are saved,” said Farrant,
dismounting hastily.</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, he tore his cloak
from his shoulders to cast it about the slender figure
that swayed as it stood; then he swung himself
into the saddle again, and, stooping, caught her
hands in both of his.</p>

<p>“Can you put your foot on my boot?” he asked.
“Nay, then, by this mound. So—now in my arms!
(On, Bess!) You are not afraid? Courage, madam,
’tis but a few yards to my house, to warmth and
shelter!”</p>

<p>His arms still shook with excitement as he grasped
the muffled figure and the reins as best he might.
And the mare slowly lifted her heavy hoofs stable-ward
again.</p>

<p>His frenzy lest his chance should escape, his evil
joy over his prize, burned like fire in his veins. And
something of his blood heat seemed to pass into the
half-frozen woman. She stirred with more vitality
in his grasp, settled herself with more definite volition
on the mare’s broad shoulder, and heaved a
sigh of returning energy. Suddenly she started;
and he clutched her, alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“My servants!” she said, and turned her head so
that her breath fanned his cheeks. Her dilated eyes
were close to his in the snow-light.</p>

<p>“Madam?” He held her the tighter and urged
forward.</p>

<p>“My servants, sir,” she repeated, a thrill of
impatience running through her quick utterance.
“They will return to find me gone!”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” he made answer, driving his heels
into their steed’s bulging sides, “I will even send
presently to the coach, and warn them of your
safety.… They will be welcome likewise.…
But we must go on—yonder is my gate—a very
little while and you shall be by the fireside.”</p>

<p>As he turned off the road he cast a look backward
down the slope and noticed a brace of yellow lights
bobbing through the misty white of the valley:
the traveller’s servants were returning with succour.
Not a minute too much had fate granted him!
But are not the ready ever the successful?</p>

<p>His boyish face was astir with silent laughter as he
gathered the lady into his arms upon the threshold
of his own door-step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="FARRANT_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RANSOM</span></h3>

<p>Rockhurst was roused from deep reverie by the
opening of the door. His mind had been far indeed
from Farrant Chace and his own unprofitable
present existence—as far away as the days of
youth; days of inspiration and hope; of delicate
illusion even in sorrow; days of strife, when loyalty
was an exquisite passion, and the blood that ran in
his veins sang to shed itself for his King! Days
when friendship was near and dear as love, and love
itself the golden fruit of an endless mystery. He
was of those who grasp at life with both hands.
None had brought a younger heart to his youth; no
man faced his fulfilled manhood with less illusion.
He had wanted much, he had received much, he had
taken much—and all had failed him.</p>

<p>He raised his head and stared, almost as if he were
dreaming, at the two who entered upon his brooding
solitude; two that might have come upon him out
of that long-past youth—the lad with the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the friend he had loved, and this vision of young
womanhood, whose beauty shone like a pearl from
the dark setting of her hood. But as soon as Paul
Farrant spoke the spell was broken.</p>

<p>“A ransom, my lord—a ransom out of the snow!”</p>

<p>The twist of the speaker’s lip, the glint of his eye,
gave triumphant meaning to the words.</p>

<p>Rockhurst rose from his chair, the weary look
returning to his face. Here, after all, was but the
degenerate son of the man whose blood had been his
own baptism to noble sorrow. And the sapling
slight creature with virginal eyes and soft lips who
was leaning upon Paul Farrant’s arm? Why—she
was but his ransom!—Nay, these were no longer
the days of white-souled Falkland, or generous
Hampden, days of chivalrous if hopeless devotion to
ideals: these were the days of the merry Monarch,
where none could feel a higher sweet than Pleasure,
nor feel a deeper pang than Envy.… How
far away the days of Youth!</p>

<p>She was but his ransom! And the young man’s
words of promise, which had seemed so empty when
they were pronounced, “we may not be so destitute
of entertaining company at Farrant Chace as your
lordship deems,” came back to his mind, and with a
new, cynical meaning. Fair company in sooth! But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
how, here “out of the snow,” lured by what prospect
of light amusement, what offered guerdon, he could
only surmise. Possibly some traveller from the inn,
ready with all the ease of these times to snatch at
pleasure where it offered itself.…</p>

<p>A lady, by every movement of eye and limb. A
lady! Bah! was it not the fashion among ladies
now to be as eager of base adventure as the gallants
themselves?</p>

<p>He stood on one side while, with an exaggerated
gallantry, Farrant conducted the stranger to Rockhurst’s
just vacated seat, helped her to loosen her
cloak, and pressed some wine upon her from the
neglected goblets on the table.</p>

<p>When the lady had sipped, and returned the glass
into his hand, she spoke at last.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she said, smiling. “But, my
servants…?”</p>

<p>Her voice was a little faint and plaintive yet, from
the numbing of the cold, but it had a grave ring in
it that fell pleasantly on Rockhurst’s fastidious ear.</p>

<p>“Another taste, madam; we will inquire about
your servants anon. The mistress must first be
waited upon,” cried young Paul, all agog in ostentatious
attendance, and ever flinging a restless glance
of inquiry at his Rockhurst. “Fie! Your cloak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is heavy with wet. Let me move these dripping
folds away from you. And your feet, oh, I protest!”
He was down on his knees now, his young head
glinting in the glow as he bent assiduously over his
new task. “Your feet—ice!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, he drew the little doeskin
shoe from her foot; and, as she instinctively lifted
it toward the blaze, knelt back so that Rockhurst
might see the firelight play upon its delicate shape.</p>

<p>The warmth of the wine and of the hearth had
stirred her chilled blood. A flush, like the tint of a
seashell, crept into her face; into her dazed eyes
appeared a light to which the blue shadows of
weariness on the lids gave a singular brilliancy;
she very simply stretched her other foot for the
kindly office.</p>

<p>As Farrant rose at last, with the second shoe
dangling in his hand, his exultation broke out. He
drew close, and whispered:—</p>

<p>“Say, my lord, shall we not be right well entertained
to-night?”</p>

<p>“We?” echoed Rockhurst, aloud.</p>

<p>The single contemptuous exclamation fell like
the cut of a whip. He turned, and bowing to the
visitor, who had turned startled eyes toward him:—</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “I heard you express some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
anxiety about your attendants. Our young friend
is about to fulfil your request … whatever it
may be.—Go,” added he, turning upon the disconcerted
youth. And as Farrant hesitated he took
a swift step nearer to him, and whispered in his
turn, “Go—to the devil or where you will, so long
as it is out of this!”</p>

<p>His eye commanded more insolently yet than
his words. The young man fell back, flung a look of
hesitation toward the crumpled notes on the table;
another glance at the lady, his fair treasure-trove.
Then, with a meaning smile, he bowed profoundly,
so that all his shining curls fell over his face, and
withdrew.</p>

<p>Rockhurst caught the smile and the look; and
the memory of a dead face, that of his old brother in
arms, the boy’s father, in its last stern serenity rose
up before him. His own eyes were hard as he looked
again upon the woman who had been found so
promptly willing to come and relieve the tedium
of his snow-bound evening.</p>

<p class="caption">The single contemptuous exclamation fell like the cut of a whip.</p>
</div>

<p>Diana Harcourt, with the return of physical comfort
about her, had begun to feel a strange uneasiness
gather in her mind. Country-bred, and country-wed
to an old man who had little taste for company,
she had yet had some opportunities of learning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
way of courts; she, for instance, had no doubt
that the youth who had saved her from the snow
was of gentle birth, and that this grave-looking
being, with whom she now found herself alone in the
strange, silent house, was a very fine gentleman
indeed. Nevertheless, something singular, something
not quite open, clandestine almost, in the
situation began to force itself upon her. What
was the relationship between these two men? The
eyes of the elder, who might have been the other’s
father, were cold to dislike as he had gazed upon him.
And the young man’s febrile excitement came back
upon her memory with an impression of distaste
amounting to repulsion. What had lurked behind
his smile, his furtive, appraising glance? She
recalled how innocently she had allowed him to
touch her feet, and, flushing hotly, she cast her
mantle over them and turned her head with a little
movement, at once dignified and shy, to gaze upon
Rockhurst. But suspicion fell from her on the
instant.—Noble-looking, grave, high-bred, old
enough to be her own father, what could she have
to fear?</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said boldly, “will you not have the
kindness now to tell me where I am, and with
whom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Rockhurst drew up a chair and sat him down, deliberately
facing her. Then he crossed his fine white
hands upon his knee, letting his eyes rest upon hers.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said at last, “do you not hear how
the wind begins again to moan outside? I warrant
you, behind the thick walls of this old house the snow
is whirling in great white drifts. It must be parlous
cold without. Here, madam, the firelight is rosy;
do you not think we are very well together? ’Tis
a quaint hour, stolen from dull old Time’s grudging
casket. We do not know each other—why,
that has a marvellous charm of its own! Let us
not dispel it. We may never meet again; and to-morrow
you go back … to the white snow.
And I to the fever of the town. And that, perhaps,
will be well, too.”</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated as she listened, scarce with fear,
but again with the unexplained foreboding.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, after a pause, “your words are very
strange; I do not understand them.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Rockhurst, his languid lids
drooping a little now over the first keenness of his
gaze, which seemed to narrow his scrutiny to something
cruel as a blade, “I have just said it, ’tis a
dull world. Will you complain of its strangeness
once in a way? Why have you covered up your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pretty foot? I vow I thought of Diana in the woodland
glades when I saw the arch of its instep.”
And, saying this, he opened his brilliant glance
once more full upon her. “Diana did I say?” he
cried. “Nay, no cold goddess! Far from me the
omen!… A nymph. Aurora, with the sun in
her hair, and all the roses in her cheeks!”</p>

<p>The blood which had rushed violently to Diana
Harcourt’s temples ebbed away as quickly, leaving
her white as the drifts without.</p>

<p>These were, no doubt, but idle words of gallantry;
and all her woman’s instinctive pride warned her
against the shame of seeming to attach any other
significance to them. Yet whether glinting between
half-closed lids or widely open upon her, the man’s
eyes seemed to her to have some terrible, some merciless
thought in them—a thought strangely at
variance with the dignity of his appearance, the
gravity, almost the sadness of his countenance;
horribly at variance with the grey which besprinkled
the raven of his locks.</p>

<p>“I am not of the town, and not accustomed to
fine speeches and compliments.…”</p>

<p>She framed the phrase in pitiful attempt to stem
the panic that was gaining upon her. He still sat
motionless, his hands crossed, half smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir,” she cried, now angrily, “are there no women
in this place? Will you not, in courtesy, allow me
the company of one, till my servants arrive?”</p>

<p>“My dear,” he answered her sarcastically, “will
my company not really suffice?”</p>

<p>Rockhurst had had Heaven or Hades knew what
vast experience of women, of the women of Second
Charles’s Court, whether in exile or in Whitehall.
Scarce a challenging beauty of the posy that he had
not measured swords with; and, as the practised
fencer will, he knew every trick of the play, every line
of assault and defence, every feint and every parry.
And women, being proverbially unfair fighters, pretty
dears! he had a smile as well as a wary eye for
the tricky pass and the treacherous thrust. Of all
the feints, that of innocence in straits, of outraged
modesty, was the most elementary. This divine
young creature with the copper-glowing hair and the
wide-dilating eyes; whose blood ran so richly and so
quickly; who had come in leaning familiarly on the
arm of that prince of petty rakes, Paul Farrant,
come willingly, it seemed, across the snows, to his
bidding; who had suffered herself to be unshod with
all the unblushing ease of any Whitehall coquette—why,
if it now pleased her to play the pretty Puritan,
he had no objection, save that, as he knew himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he was apt to be swiftly wearied. The spark of
interest kindled by her unaccustomed kind of beauty,
by the something fresh and of the woodland about
her, by the utter unexpectedness of her appearance
and the mystery it pleased him she should maintain,
would so soon flicker out. In love, as in war, he
had but one method—straight ahead. In war he
had been beaten back sometimes; in love, never.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, sitting up at last and slowly
stretching out one hand. “Come, Diana, since
Diana you will be.” (Again she started on hearing
herself unwittingly called by her real name.) “Be
Diana, if you please, to me. What if I am no Endymion?
Bah, my dear goddess,” and he drew his
lean frame out of the chair and came over to her
with the same deliberate grace, “that was a little
mistake of yours to be so ready to stoop to yonder
youth! Endymion is but a callow rascal, a greenhorn.
When such beings as you descend from your
high celestial ways it should be for a man! Come,
do you wish me to kneel at your feet, as your shepherd
did even now? I will, an’ it please you.”</p>

<p>His arms were almost about her, when, with a fierce
movement, she sprang up and thrust him from her.</p>

<p>“In the name of God,” she cried, “into what trap
have I fallen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, do not scream,” he said, at one step placing
himself between her and the door, and catching her
wrist, without roughness, but with that steel-like
grasp she had instinctively divined under his gentle
movements. “Let us clear this strange matter
between us two, madam.—Answer you first:
What purpose had you in coming here to-night?”</p>

<p>“I?” she flashed back at him, panting. “Purpose?—Purpose,
sir?… That young man
found me in the snow, the coach had foundered, my
servants ridden away for help, I was perished from
cold. Purpose? Let me go, sir. Rather the snow!
Oh, let me hence from your horrible house!”</p>

<p>He released her and stood looking at her in silence.
Again, even in her turmoil of terror and passion, she
was struck by the extraordinary dignity of his air.
But to look thus, and to act thus!</p>

<p>“Oh, shame,” she said; “you who might be my
father!”</p>

<p>A swift shadow came over his countenance, then
passed, leaving it set into marble impassivity. His
eyelids drooped. Forgetting her cloak on the chair,
forgetting her shoeless feet, she thought she saw her
chance, and made a rush for the door; but he
arrested her with a gesture.</p>

<p>“No!” he said authoritatively. Then, fixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
his eyes upon her with an altered look: “No, child,”
he repeated. His voice was as much changed as his
gaze. Gone from it the dangerous, even silkiness
of his first speeches to her, as well as the quick
sternness of the last words. This new voice, something
said to her, was the voice of the real self that
matched the noble countenance.</p>

<p>He put out his hand. After a pause she put hers
on it. Later she wondered at herself that she had
done so. But there are moments when some poignant
emotion tears away the bodily mask, when
souls are suddenly laid bare to each other. For
some of us that is the moment when our belief in
all that is good and beautiful dies. But Diana, in
that flashing look into the soul of this unknown
man (who had yet, within so short a measure of time,
insulted her) read that to which her own soul leaped.
The storm subsided in her heart. She suffered him
to conduct her back to the chair by the fire, and
watched him—wonderingly, yet no longer with
fear—as he straightened himself and, with folded
arms, stood yet a little while contemplating her.</p>

<p>In the hawk’s eyes there was a softened shadow.
As he gazed the shadow deepened into tenderness.—He
was looking at her as the exile might look at the
receding shore of the land he will never see again;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
with a yearning that has passed beyond despair,
and so grown serene. At length, sighing, he roused
himself, and came forward, pushed the heavy table
closer to her, and brought within her reach some of
the viands that were spread upon it.</p>

<p>“You must eat,” he said. And, as she lifted
her eyes again with her childlike, questioning look,
his lips parted in a smile she thought beautiful,
upon the gravity of his countenance: “You have
not done with journeying yet to-night,” he explained.</p>

<p>He moved to the window as he spoke; and, as
he drew the curtains aside, there came into the ruddy
brown room a vision of a moonlit fairy world.</p>

<p>“There, too, I was wrong, you see,” he went on,
speaking over his shoulder; “the snow-storms are
passed, and there is your sister moon to show you
the way—Diana.” Then, coming back again to
the table, “You asked for a woman’s company. In
this house there is no company fit for you.”</p>

<p>Her eyelid flickered over her startled glance.
She gave a quick cry.</p>

<p>“Eat, then,” he went on in the same gentle tone,
“while I make arrangements for your instant departure.”</p>

<p>The door was shut behind him. Diana involuntarily
called after him; but his footsteps died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
away in the empty passages. The great silence of the
house closed about her; and in the solitude her own
thoughts seemed to clamour and crowd bodily upon
her. She leaned her elbows on the table and buried
her bright head in her hands.</p>

<p>Slighted … insulted … then served reverentially
like a princess … looked at and spoken
to like a beloved child. How was it that all the
anger was dead in her heart, and that in its place
reigned this feeling of pain and incomprehensible
joy commingled? How was it that her fear was
banished, that she would have trusted herself with
him even in this house which his own lips had named
evil?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="FARRANT_IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">UNDER THE STARS</span></h3>

<p>Presently she again heard steps without and rapid
words; then his voice, uplifted sharp and strong.
She smiled, broke a piece of bread and sipped at the
wine; she was safe, she knew, where he was. And
she would eat, if only because he bade her.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Rockhurst returned. He was
now booted to the thigh, and carried a cloak on his
arm. Once more he sat down facing her. His eye
fell on the discarded shoes; he bent down and felt
them.</p>

<p>“They are nearly dry,” he said, and lifted them
closer to the flame. “In a little while you must be
ready. You will have to ride on the same rustic
steed that brought you, but I will see that she carries
you to safety.” He paused a second or two, then
added: “The inn—a very well-known, reputable
place—is not far distant; and you will doubtless
hear of your servants there. Our young host,” he
hesitated, and his voice seemed to harden, “tells me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that, even as he rode with you into the avenue, folk
were hastening to your rescue from that direction.”</p>

<p>Diana’s glance still questioned, but she dared not
put the question into words. What, then, had the
young man with the narrow eyes and the uneasy
glance meant by her? And how, if he had had
some dark purpose, had she been thrust upon this
other and left to his mercy? Ah, and what had this
other at first fancied to see in her? The blood surged
to her cheeks, her lips trembled. Rockhurst held
her under his eye. As if in answer to her thoughts
he bent down.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, but how differently the words,
a while ago insolently familiar, were now spoken;
“this is no house for you. It must never be breathed
of one such as you that you have been under its
roof—with one such as me. You said you did not
know the ways of us of the Court—pray God you
may never know them!”</p>

<p>Here he was silent again, his eye resting thoughtfully
upon her hands, unadorned save for a single
posy ring.</p>

<p>“When you marry,” he went on then, as with an
effort, “keep in the sweet country, and of a surety,”
a sad smile flickered upon his lip, “your lord will
gladly keep there, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>She lifted her head with a quick impulse; her mouth
parted to speak. But an inexplicable, invincible reluctance
to tell him she was already wed thrust back
the words.</p>

<p>Rockhurst turned, and taking the loose pieces
of paper from the table, gazed at them thoughtfully
for a moment, and thrust them into his pocket.
Then he rose, and almost gaily:—</p>

<p>“Come, madam,” he said, “your palfrey waits in
the cold. Put on your shoes.” As he spoke he
took down his sword and buckled it on.</p>

<p>She went forth with him, her finger-tips lightly
in his hold, without a word, through the passages
of the lone house, through the hall. The door,
open to the night, cut a square, brilliant silver upon
the inner dimness. Cold, pure airs rushed against
them.</p>

<p>The mare, black, steaming, stood patiently, her
bridle hitched to a post. There was not a sound of
another living thing, it seemed, in all the white-shrouded
land. She rested one hand on the saddle-cloth,
lifted her foot for his service, and he swung
her up with practised ease. She felt the strength
of a steel bow in his arm. He folded her in a huge
horseman’s cloak; then, without a word, took the
bridle to walk by her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him wistfully. Had she dared, she
would have invited him to share the saddle. But,
dark and grave, he went beside her, and the silence
held them.</p>

<p class="tb">They moved as in a dream through a dreamland
of beauty, a white purity beyond expression. Above,
in the pine trees, the wind choired; far out over
the waste it sighed. Somewhere very far away, yet
strangely distinct, Christmas joy bells were ringing.</p>

<p>The starry sky that domed this wonderful world
was still more wonderful. Diana neither felt the
cold, nor measured the space she traversed, nor the
flight of time. She was another self; she would
have asked no greater boon than to journey on
through all this splendour, with the vision of his face
cut in grave beauty against the white world, to meet
the glance of his watchful eye now and again, to
have the touch of his hand, kind and steady, upon
her knee, when the road was rougher and the mare
stumbled. She knew that at that unknown inn door,
down in the valley, would come the parting, and her
heart contracted.</p>

<p class="tb">The little village seemed asleep. The inn itself
looked deep in slumber, with barred windows, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
every gable huddled under the thick blanket of
snow; only a wreathing smoke from the chimney-stack
to tell of some watchfulness within.</p>

<p>Rockhurst knocked, masterfully, sonorously.
Then turning, the rein slung over his arm, he leaned
against a pillar of the porch, removed his hat, and
looked up smiling at her. There came sounds,
answering sounds, indoor. Then he spoke:—</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you thank me?” Her voice shook a little.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he repeated, “for having shown
me, once more, a vision of my youth such as I never
thought to know again!”</p>

<p>The bars were now heard grating against the
closed door. Rockhurst took a step forward.
She read farewell in his eyes; and, flinging out both
her hands, almost with a sob:—</p>

<p>“Ah, but shall we not meet again?” she said
pleadingly. “Your name? Mine—nay, you know
it already. It is indeed Diana. Diana—”</p>

<p>But he interrupted her with a quick gesture.</p>

<p>“Hush! My name? No, it is a name of no
good report, and I would not have it dwell in your
mind. And yours—it were best I should not
know it.…” Then, after a slight pause:
“You come as a dream to me, you go as a dream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
perfect, sweet, beyond words. We shall never meet
again, Diana.”</p>

<p>The inn doors were slowly drawing apart. He
lifted his arms to help her down, held her a second
between them to steady her, then, putting her gently
aside, sprang into the saddle and forthwith spurred
the mare to her heavy trot.</p>

<p>And Diana, looking after them, saw rider and
mount passing from her, black against the snow.
He never turned his head. She stood, bewilderment
in her mind, pain at her heart.</p>

<p>“God-a-mercy, madam, ’tis you!” cried the
familiar voice of her old servant in her ear. “In
the Lord’s name, madam, where have you been?”
old Geoffrey was tremblingly questioning.</p>

<p>She started, looking round at him as one suddenly
awakened. Was it all indeed a dream of the snow?
she asked herself, as the sheltering doors of the
Anchor, at Liphook, closed upon her.</p>

<p class="tb">The sudden spurt of old Bess the mare soon
gave place to her usual jog. Through the silent
snow she carried her rider back to the door of Farrant
Chace. The rhythmic jingle of her bit, the monotonous
muffled plunge of her hoofs, the wail of the
wind over the down, seemed to point the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
stillness, even as the sparse black firs pointed the
immense whiteness of the waste.</p>

<p>Rockhurst stepped in again into the warmth of
the parlour, snow sodden on his boots, hoar frost
pricking his hair, and found Paul Farrant.</p>

<p class="tb">To the young man’s frenzied anxiety it seemed
interminable nights that he had been thus waiting,
waiting for release or doom; nights that he had
paced the brown parlour from end to end; that he
had stood shivering in the window recess, gazing
out upon the white emptiness, straining his ears for
a sound of life in the awful stillness. The uncertainty
of Rockhurst’s moods, of his intentions, the
mystery that had to-night surrounded his movements,
added to the waiting misery. To what
end had Rakehell set forth, at midnight through the
snow, with the lady whom he had so cynically received?
Was it a sudden whim of chivalrous courtesy?
His scorching anger upon their last brief
meeting might lead him to that preposterous conclusion—Knight
Errant Rakehell, out through the
snowdrifts on a farm mare for the sake of country
virtue! (What tale might he not make of it for
supper merriment at Whitehall!) Or Rakehell,
jealous of his host’s fair looks and smooth cheek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
carrying off elsewhere the prize of grace and
beauty.…</p>

<p>At such a point Farrant’s uneasy tread would
lead him back to the hearth, to seek vain comfort
by the embers, to fling fresh logs on the reddening
pile. What was he to do if Rockhurst were to pass
away from his road like this? Dare he, so long as
those damning notes were in that pitiless hold, ever
present himself within earshot of Court?</p>

<p class="tb">Then all at once, as he sat staring into his uncertain
future, his guest was back upon him—those were
his steps without, that was his hand on the latch!
Farrant sprang to his feet, and flung a look of
piteous inquiry at the great lord’s face.</p>

<p>Rockhurst did not speak. He went to the hearth
and stood for an appreciable pause gazing at the
lad; in his eyes there was none of the former scorn—nothing
but a kind of sad wonder. Then, deliberately,
he drew the damning slips of paper from his
pocket, turned, and, one by one, with a musing air,
threw them into the fire.</p>

<p>Farrant drew a quivering breath of relief. The
“debt of honour” was cancelled.</p>

<h2>THE ENIGMA OF THE LOCKET</h2>

<h3 id="ENIGMA_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">LITTLE SATAN</span></h3>

<p>Enguerrand de Joncelles—<i lang="fr">Monsieur le Vidame
de Joncelles</i>, as he preferred to be called—was
new to courts. To the court of Whitehall, <i lang="fr">la cour
de Witalle</i> he had it, he was yet altogether a stranger.</p>

<p>From the noble monotony of Joncelles, the great
poverty-stricken chateau which raised its pepper-box
turrets above meagre apple orchards, a league
south of Caen, to the excitement of the Louvre and
Versailles; from the rigidity of the maternal rule
at home (in her retirement, Madame de Joncelles,
a confidant and friend of the late Queen Mother of
France, had never compromised on matters of
discipline, and had cherished theories on the education
of young men) to complete emancipation—here
had been steps high enough to upset the balance
of any quick-blooded and good-looking youth of
eighteen. But the little Vidame had found his feet,
as the saying goes, with astonishing ease, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the austere old lady, departing for a better world,
left him to face this one by himself.</p>

<p>The new mourning had scarce had time to be fitted
to his comely figure before the whole youth himself
had become a different being. There are some
whom a single glass of wine intoxicates; Enguerrand
de Joncelles was intoxicated at the very first
sip of life.… Such a flutter of silk and curls;
such constellations of eyes, brilliant or melting or
mockingly challenging; such lightning of wit; such
whispers, such sighs! In one day he had learned to
return, with interest, an <i lang="fr">œillade</i> that, within the
precincts of Caen Cathedral, would have made
him drop a modest lid—and set him dreaming for
a week. Within a very little while more he had
mastered the art of capturing a soft hand and holding
it hidden in tender pressure, the while presenting
a decorous front to stately company. He had also
learned to look down in the right measure of disdain
upon the burgher; to bandy, in all delicacy, audacious
pleasantry with his equals on the Grand Staircase
of the Louvre, or in the <i lang="fr">Galérie de l’Œil-de-Bœuf</i>.
He could whip out his new-mode small-sword
with as swift a grace as the best noted ruffler.
He was able to be more obviously dazzled by the
splendour of the <i lang="fr">Roy-Soleil</i> than many a past-master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sycophant—withal cultivating a fine insensibility
of outward aspect, keeping the delicate
beauty of his features set as in a fine white mask,
his voice low-toned—only now and again permitting
the wide-pupilled black eyes to betray by a flash the
constant alertness of the inner mind.</p>

<p>These demure airs gave a singular piquancy to the
boldness of his words and deeds, one which was not
without its special effect in that court of solemn
sham and wearisome etiquette. Heaven only knows
where the precious only son of Madame de Joncelles
had found such sudden knowledge of the world,
such astuteness and such recklessness combined. It
was a merciful Providence that spared his pious
mother the sight of the ultimate blossoming of her
carefully pruned young tree!</p>

<p>Attached (together with his sister, Madame de
Mantes, a noted beauty of Versailles) to the train
of Madame Henriette d’Orléans, on the occasion of
that princess’s first journey to England since the
happy restoration of her royal brother, he now was
ushered to the court of Whitehall. What the apt
youth here saw and learned filled him deep with
surprise—a surprise, however, which he was careful
not to betray. Beyond doubt it was a merry place,
this court of Charles—if its methods were a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
astonishing. Enguerrand was not one who would
let pass a single opportunity for self-instruction, and
now and again, despite his impassive attitude where
the natural acuteness of his wits failed him, he condescended
to ask for information.</p>

<p class="tb">He was in a questioning mood, this night at Whitehall,
when, for the first time, he was admitted to the
King’s more private circle. By good adventure, he
found himself beside a gentleman who seemed to
possess an intimate knowledge of the royal ways
as well as an amiable readiness to impart it. This
was an elderly little man of the name of Petherick,
who once, evidently, had been handsome, and was
still à la mode. As Enguerrand was to learn later,
Mr. Petherick justified his established position at
Court by a notable ingenuity in discovering fresh
sources of amusement for the easily wearied Charles.
Now the acute person’s eye rested critically upon the
elegance of the foreign boy; his Majesty liked new
faces and new fashions, and his Majesty especially
liked the French.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Petherick, as if pursuing his thought
aloud, “the King is vastly fond of your country,
Vidame—and of your countrywomen, just now.
See—that divine dark creature that came with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Madame Henriette; I’ve laid a wager, to wit, that
her Royal Highness will have to leave her lady-in-waiting
behind, when she returns to France.”</p>

<p>“Sir—you mean, I see, Madame de Mantes,”
said Enguerrand, coolly. “My sister.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur de Joncelles…? Ah, of course, Madame
de Mantes is married. And M. de Mantes?”</p>

<p>“Say was married—happily widowed within a
few months,” said the little Vidame, with elaborate
coolness. And from his post slightly in the background
he gazed at the brilliant royal circle and
singled out the familiar dark curly head, the peach-like
cheek, the childlike lustrous eyes with quite a
new interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherick had too good an experience of the
Court not to be more than ever gracious to a newcomer,
who proved to be the brother of a beauteous
sister.</p>

<p>Following the direction of the Vidame’s eyes, he
pointed out the personalities of major importance—handsome
Castlemaine, sullen and aggressive to-night;
and fair Stewart with her childish face and
her studied coldness of demeanour, and put Master
Enguerrand <i lang="fr">au courant</i> of some spicy snippets.
Buckingham proclaimed himself by his magnificence,
his insolence, and his gaiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“But pray,” put in the Vidame, “who may the tall,
dark gentleman be, who sits in such silence behind
his Majesty, and who, even when the King speaks,
seems to have forgot how to smile.… He has
a handsome presence—although no longer young,
at all.” (Thus, the superb arrogance of his own
springtime!) “Do you mark, Monsieur Petherick,
how my little sister keeps seeking his notice with
languishing eyes—aye, even with his Majesty’s
own gaze upon her … the perverse one! Pray,
who is the gentleman?”</p>

<p>“How!” cried Mr. Petherick, “a whole week
already in Whitehall, and not yet acquainted with
the Rakehell? Why, sir, it is our King’s own
familiar, an old comrade of the wars and of exile.
His Majesty can do nought without my lord Viscount
Rockhurst—my merry Rockhurst, he has
dubbed his lordship, in a raillery, you will understand,
of that countenance which keeps its gravity
through the maddest freak. And mad he can be,
sir; hence that nickname of Rakehell, which no
doubt has astonished your French elegancy.—Nay,
but in truth there is an eye that wanders, as you say,
prodigious languorously upon my lord Constable!”
Mr. Petherick went on, narrowing his own watchful
gaze: “I congratulate you, Vidame, upon your fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sister … yet, I trust she is as wise as she is fair.…
Aye, you say true, and your young wits are
quicker than mine; the Lord Constable—my lord
Rockhurst is constable, I should inform you,
of his Majesty’s Tower and captain of the Yeomen
of the Guard—and in sooth the one gentleman
about the presence who would dare, and for the mere
deviltry of it, to place himself in rivalry with the
King … to nip the quarry, as it were, from under
Old Rowley’s nose!”</p>

<p>“Old Rowley?” questioned Enguerrand, his
dark eyes flashing wide. He had a side smile, as he
spoke, for his sister and her astuteness. He could
trust Jeanne to be wise.</p>

<p>Petherick coughed behind a lean hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, a name, sir. A name, by which his Majesty’s
intimates dare, now and then, to call him—ahem!
when not in the presence—a foolish habit.
I know not how the absurdity slipped from my
tongue.”</p>

<p>“Nay, neither do I,” said the little cool Vidame.</p>

<p>His glance wandered back with sharper set curiosity
to the royal circle. Charles had a languid hand
amid the curls of the proud, fair beauty, who sat,
erect and triumphant, beside him; the young
courtier’s thoughts ran back to his own gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
monarch, set up as upon an altar, never to be approached
save with bent spine, with double-distilled
compliments, spoken of with awe, in whispers,
as befitted his august essence. <i lang="fr">Le Roy Soleil</i>.…
Old Rowley!</p>

<p class="tb">Jeanne de Mantes had a pretty, round face with
a pointed chin, wide-set, very innocent dark eyes,
piquantly contradicted by the dainty, wicked mouth,
by every vivacious art and grace that proclaimed
one deeply learned already in the art of pleasing.
Charles, in truth, looked more often to-night at his
sister’s pretty <i lang="fr">dame d’honneur</i> than at the blond,
chill beauty who sat at his right hand; and presently,
as he looked, the King’s sardonic face relaxed
into a smile. He leaned forward and addressed
the lady in French:—</p>

<p>“I hear mounts and marvels, madam, of your
skill upon the guitar. Will you not pleasure us with
some sweet air of your fingers?”</p>

<p>Instantly every glance fell upon the Frenchwoman;
and she, with a start, brought her eyes from
their absent fixing of the Lord Constable to the visage
of the King. She fluttered. She smiled:—</p>

<p>“Your Majesty commands? ’Tis scarce worthy
of such ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Curiously enough the guitar had been brought to-night,
by the wish of Madame herself, who deemed
that his Majesty might be pleased to hear it. She
stretched out a white hand, half turning the head
with its wreath of soft black curls toward the young
man behind her:—</p>

<p>“My brother!… Vidame!”</p>

<p>It was a languid, sweet call, like the pipe of a
waking bird, which augured well for the louder
warble. The Vidame was alert; in a twinkling
he was at his sister’s side, presenting the guitar
with the arrogant grace peculiar to him.</p>

<p>But Charles, full of that curious interest in small
things which seems so marked a characteristic of
sovereigns—their lives being by fate ordained in
view of wide issues—signified by a gesture his
desire to examine the new-fashioned instrument,
and the Vidame approached the presence.</p>

<p>The silent, grave personage whose seat behind the
King, apart from the table, threw him into shadow,
looked at the young man at first with indifference;
then, of a sudden, piercingly.</p>

<p>With one arm thrown familiarly on the back of the
royal chair, he had shown himself mighty indifferent
either to the challenging glances lavished upon him,
or to the pleasantries that circled round the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the most audacious winged with a subtle flattery
for the royal attention. For the monarch himself,
who dropped him ever and anon a confidential
word, Lord Rockhurst had but a perfunctory, if
quite courteous attention. A deep mood of abstraction
had held him. But, now, his interest was
vivid, unmistakable. He stared at the Vidame;
and, as he stared, surprise seemed to pass into distaste,
almost into pain.</p>

<p>The lad paused in his advance, as if held by that
intent gaze. Then he tossed his black locks; a
sudden fire of resentment leaped and died in his
eyes, and with crimson cheeks he came swaggering
round the table, and dropped on one knee before
the King. Charles glanced curiously from him to
his Lord Constable; Rockhurst’s gaze was still
resting inscrutably upon the lad.</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish, my lord Rockhurst!” cried the King.
“You look at the pretty boy as if you saw a spectre!”</p>

<p>“Even so, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>The sonority of the voice, the strange words, fell
impressively in that light atmosphere. Again Enguerrand’s
black pupils shot fury. Rockhurst,
with the same absorbed air, laid his fingers on a
slender chain that hung round his neck, and drew
from his breast a gold locket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Opening and holding it in his hand so that none
could view it but himself, he appeared to be contrasting
some portrait concealed in it with the countenance
of the still kneeling boy.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried the King, “take heed, ladies; for,
as we live, the mystery of my lord Rockhurst’s
locket is at length to be solved. A spectre, did you
say, my lord?”</p>

<p>The Lord Constable closed the locket with a snap,
slipped it back among the laces on his breast, and
turned easily upon the King; his frown had vanished.</p>

<p>“Nay, no spectre, sire; the merest passing fantasy!”</p>

<p>Charles was shaken with laughter, a noiseless
laugh which scarcely wrote itself upon his melancholy
features.</p>

<p>“Methought, from your lenten face,” said he,
“that you were struck by some memory of past
misdeeds.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty mistakes. No memory; but a
warning!”</p>

<p>The King looked puzzled; then, with his usual
distaste for prolonged discussion, made a gesture as
if he would put the matter on one side.</p>

<p>“But that locket?” And with the words Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
de Mantes flung out a small olive finger. Since
English etiquette, it seemed, permitted every one to
speak, then she would speak. The matter had become
all at once of palpitating interest to her. The
portrait in the locket—it was evidently a portrait—he
had smiled at it. And such a smile! She took
a vow that one day this man should be made to
smile thus on her.</p>

<p>“True, true,” said Charles. “Let us see into the
secret at last, my merry Rockhurst.”</p>

<p>The Lord Constable flung himself back into his
chair.</p>

<p>“Nay, sire,” said he, and the deference of the
words became mockery in view of the attitude of
the speaker. “Your Majesty has every jurisdiction
over me—my goods, my services, my life, are
irrevocably yours to dispose of; but my thoughts
are mine own. And this locket belongs to my most
secret thoughts.”</p>

<p>Curiosity flickered once more for a moment in the
royal eye. But through drooping lids the Lord
Constable’s gaze was steel-like, and the King
shrugged his shoulders with the foreign gesture that
cleaved to him through life.</p>

<p>“God’s mercy, my lieges, that ye keep your
thoughts to yourselves, at least!” he cried, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
assumed rueful air; “for, between your lost goods
and your past services, our exchequer has enough to
meet.” He stretched out his hand for the guitar
as he spoke, and twanged ignorantly at the strings.</p>

<p>Enguerrand rose with a grin. Charles’s ingratitude
toward his ruined loyalists was no secret in
France, and the cold gibe was after his heart.</p>

<p>“Then we shall not see the locket?” cried the
Frenchwoman, disappointment ringing through her
fluted tones.</p>

<p>“How the bird twitters!” cried Charles, good-naturedly.
“Nay, my dear, curiosity was ever
fatal to your sex. Let us remain in paradise for
an hour or so. Sing!”</p>

<p>Jeanne de Mantes had a voice that matched her
looks: small, insinuating, sweet; creeping into
favour, rather than storming it; docile to a thousand
modulations and graces. Now it was the very
gaiety of music; anon just a hint of pathos; and
every word distinct as a dropping gem. And this
accompanied with here a dreamlike fixity of gaze,
there an arch roll of the eyes; here again a punctuating
dimple, a flash in the peachy, dark face of the
whitest teeth in all the world; there a drooping of
the lip that positively demanded the consolation of a
kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles had not been so stirred to enthusiasm
for a considerable time. He called for a second
ditty, and yet another. This last had an audacious
lilt, with a refrain so infectious that the royal listener
began to hum it midway and sadly out of tune.
Toward the last verse, however, under strokes waxing
ever smarter, a string broke with a plaintive sob.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i lang="fr">diable</i>!” involuntarily exclaimed the singer;
and his Majesty laughed delightedly. Then his
face changed again as he noted the compressed
lips of Lady Castlemaine and the glacial anger of
Miss Stewart. He rose and broke up the circle.
His arm on Rockhurst’s shoulder, he was about to
retire, when he paused and hummed a few notes
of the last song once more.</p>

<p>“A linnet,” he said, “a positive linnet! Odd’s fish!
but we’d have her pipe to us when we might give
her our whole attention.”</p>

<p>He spoke low, and flung back a look, that held a
certain apprehension, toward Miss Stewart. This
latter stood very erect, and bore a studied air of
indifference.</p>

<p>“If your lordship will look to it—” he went on,
then broke off petulantly under the glance that Rockhurst
turned upon him. “Good lack, man! I forget
how much of the Puritan there is in thee at times.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said Rockhurst, in his most
stately manner, “will find with ease an apter messenger.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the King, cynically. His narrow,
dark eye roamed a moment about the room, then
rested reflectively upon the fair mask of Enguerrand’s
face. The boy turned quickly. Charles
raised a beckoning hand.</p>

<p>“Vidame,” said the King, “a word in the hollow
of your ear!”</p>

<p>The two drew apart, while Rockhurst moved away
to the door to await the King’s pleasure. Charles
rejoined him, laughing.</p>

<p>“Faith, if I had such subjects as my cousin Louis,
I should be well served. Yes, ’tis your French
finger you want for true lightness of touch. My
honest Britons are all thumbs. The pretty singer’s
brother.… Her own brother, no less! ’Tis a
positive little Satan!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” assented Rockhurst, briefly.</p>

<p>The two went down the corridor in silence; then
Rockhurst spoke with some abruptness.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said he, “has before this, I
think, found it add to his interest in … bird-catching
that he should not be the only fowler in
the field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“How now?” said Charles, halting. The group
of attendant pages halted likewise at the end of the
gallery.</p>

<p>“I have thought,” said Rockhurst, steadily,
“I, also, that I should like that linnet to sing to
me.”</p>

<p>Charles frowned; but his favourite pursued
unmoved:—</p>

<p>“As I have only my <i lang="fr">beaux yeux</i>, as we used to say
abroad, to stake against your Majesty’s overwhelming
attractions, I should be flattered indeed, however,
were you to have me banned as a marauder.”</p>

<p>Touched upon the string of his humour, Charles
was ever easily appeased. The very impudence of
his grave constable’s proposal tickled him. It was
not the first time that they had found themselves
opposed in rivalry, though scarcely ever before so
avowedly. On the last occasion (the King remembered
this pleasantly) Rockhurst, for all his <i lang="fr">beaux
yeux</i>, had been notoriously displaced; and this,
doubtless, was a little stroke of revenge. That
was Rockhurst’s way.</p>

<p>“Beware of boasting, my lord Constable!” he
exclaimed banteringly.</p>

<p>They were on the threshold of the apartment.
Rockhurst made a deep <i lang="fr">congé</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never boast, as your Majesty knows. But
your Majesty was wont to love a fair wager.”</p>

<p>Charles’s smile widened. He nodded assent, and
Rockhurst pursued after a moment’s reflection:—</p>

<p>“Will your Majesty stake the payment of all the
arrears due to my yeomen’s company that the linnet’s
first song will not be for me? I would wager in
return their immediate settlement, out of my own
estate, unless your Majesty would impose on me
any other stake.”</p>

<p>“Admirable!” said the King. “Yet we would have
a more immediate, a more personal, token of victory—if
we succeed against your <i lang="fr">beaux yeux</i>,” he put
in with a little mockery, “and that is, in addition
to the paltry coin, a view of the contents of that
locket, my merry Rockhurst.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst hesitated, then bowed. “So be it,
sire,” said he.</p>

<p>And hereupon Charles retired, laughing, in cynical
anticipation of a good stroke of business. That
ever-present question of arrears of pay was a persistent
annoyance to the royal conscience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="ENIGMA_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">WHITEHALL STAIRS</span></h3>

<p>“Little Satan”—bestowed from lips royal in
terms of favour, the nickname cleaved congenially
to Enguerrand—entered, into the rôle of King’s
Mercury with all the <i lang="fr">verve</i> expected of him. But
he was considerably surprised at the manner in
which his embassy was received. To place the
most unworthy motives invariably foremost was, he
flattered himself, to display a thorough knowledge
of woman. He had yet to learn the thousand
sensibilities that distinguish even the frail of that
elusive sex from the unscrupulous gallant.</p>

<p>As he paused on his announcement, fully expecting
to descry in the new recipient of the royal favour
at least as much gratification as he himself experienced
in being singled out as confidential messenger,
he was met by a sudden pouncing movement, expressive
only of wrath, by a dark look, actually by a
flush.</p>

<p>Had Jeanne de Mantes ever blushed? It might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
be a matter of doubt. But she could colour high
with displeasure; and very becoming it was.</p>

<p>“What, sir?” she cried. “I cannot have understood
aright. Is this the Vidame de Joncelles, the
French gentilhomme, the servant of Madame
Henriette de France—is this my compatriot, my
own brother, who comes to make me such a proposition?—It
is really not to credit one’s ears!…”</p>

<p>Brother and sister faced each other, strangely
alike now in their anger: nostrils quivering over
fierce, quick breaths, black eyes flashing into black
eyes.</p>

<p>It was the Vidame who could scarce credit his
ears. Here was he, the messenger of the King, come
to open before one whose devouring ambition, he
believed, if anything, exceeded his own, a perspective
of boundless possibilities—and he was thus
received! He sat before her in the small parlour
allotted to her in Whitehall,—an exiguous rounded
corner room overlooking the river,—his mouth
opened in astonishment, deserted for the nonce by
all his pert airs of assurance.</p>

<p>“Nay, Jeanne,” he said at length, “keep this
pretty scene for his Majesty, if you will; or rather,”
he amended, restored by the sound of his own glib
speech, “take my advice, and hold your fits of virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as cured and over, once for all, for they say that King
Charles becomes very easily <i lang="fr">ennuyé</i>. For, with me,
whom do you expect to take in?”</p>

<p>Whereupon, at a tangent, Madame de Mantes
flew into a new rage.</p>

<p>“And it is this little man who is my brother!”
she cried, clasping her hands and surveying Enguerrand
from head to foot, with flashing fury;
“<em>this</em> is the child who knelt beside me at our mother’s
knee!”</p>

<p>She thrust out a lip of utter contempt: “Take thee
in? Thou—thou little withered fruit … a stone
inside, hard skin without; what art thou to me?”</p>

<p>“What am I to thee—Jeanne? To-day,” he
cried, “the stepping-stone to thy fortune, if thou wilt
only see it! Now listen to me.”</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, of a sudden his anger
cooled before the expression of her face. What if
she was in earnest, what of his fortunes then? It
was no time to quarrel. He caught his sister round
the waist and advanced his lips toward the smooth
cheek. But a masterly slap met the endearment.</p>

<p>“I’ll be no stepping-stone to you, nor creature of
the English King,” Jeanne announced, half laughing,
half crying. “There’s better in London, Master
Enguerrand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her with wicked eyes, his face whiter
than usual against the three scarlet stripes.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a visit this morning before me!”
he cried suddenly; then, with a diabolic flash of
intuition, he recalled the long, soft looks she had cast
upon Lord Rockhurst.</p>

<p>“A visit?” said the Frenchwoman, swinging herself
upon her heel. “Why, yes, that might well be.”
She had a private smile, as to the memory of something
singularly pleasant.</p>

<p>“I warrant me that it is your purpose to visit
before long that interesting pile they call the Tower
of London. Have a care, <i lang="fr">ma sœur</i>,” and his
trembling lips could scarce articulate the sneer,—had
he not hated that man at very first sight,—“it
is there, they say, that heads are lost in England!”</p>

<p>“Out of my room!” she ordered.</p>

<p>He laughed in what was almost a convulsion of
rage. To what post, to what favours, might he not
have aspired, with such a beginning! Meanwhile
it is always the messenger of unwelcome news who
bears the blame. <i lang="fr">Malédiction!</i> His hand on the
door-latch, he sent his last shaft with deadly purport
to wound:—</p>

<p>“O Jeanne, and I had never thought thee the
woman to submit to a rival! Call to mind, <i lang="fr">ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
toute belle</i>, milord’s smile as he gazed at the face
in the locket.”</p>

<p>Madame de Mantes heard the furious laughter
echo down the passage as the door closed. She
stood in the middle of her little room nibbling at her
finger. ’Twas true! He had smiled at the locket,
and with what tenderness! Ah, that was very
different from the mocking twist of the lips with
which he had wittily courted her only an hour ago.
How! a king was to be sacrificed to him, and the
man dared to haggle over the full surrender of his
heart! ’Twould be monstrous!</p>

<p class="tb">“Ah, there’s my Little Satan,” said the King.
But his long, gloomy face relaxed into no mirth:
he had had a tedious morning, and of all things
Charles could least endure tedium. The lady
who had been first in favour so long that her chain
had become well-nigh as heavy as that of matrimony
itself, had made him such a scene as his own good
and faithful queen would never have permitted herself
to make. And another lady, whom for some
time the volatile royal fancy had pursued in vain,
had shown herself more hopelessly obdurate than
usual. Between chiding Palmer and elusive Stewart,
Charles was as near ill-humour as his easy temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would allow—and he was therefore, characteristically,
ready for any diversion to this unwonted
hue of his sky. The sight of the little Vidame’s
pallid, handsome face at the end of the audience
room put him in mind at once of the whim he had
indulged in overnight for the lady of the guitar;
a linnet that trilled, a little quail for roundness and
compactness.</p>

<p>For an <i lang="fr">entremet</i>, according to the new-fangled
French jargon of banqueting, Madame de Mantes
was certainly not a dish to be despised; and, to
add spice to it, there was that presumptuous fellow’s
wager. Actually a wager!—Those arrears of
pay had been forced upon the royal memory altogether
too often of late. So, with a gesture,
Charles waved his usual circle aside; and those that
formed it saw, with astonishment and the virulent
spite of the courtier, the King withdraw with the
unknown French boy into the embrasure of the
windows overlooking the Thames.</p>

<p>Some bethought themselves that his Majesty
had noticed the creature already on the previous
night; and whispers began to circulate.</p>

<p>One inventive personage declared he knew (upon
positive authority) that the little Vidame had come
on an important secret mission of the French King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
anent the necessity of Romanising the English
Church without delay. “Vidame, mark you, is an
old French ecclesiastical title,” he was good enough
to explain. “He holds his lands in feu from some
mighty Archbishopric—formerly a Vidame was
a kind of ecclesiastical marshal—does not this
furnish food for reflection, my lords? But—”
“Pooh,” cried an airy gallant (who had a French
tilt to his moustache), “our good Dorset has ever
Rome in his head. Why, man, a Vidame and his
Bishop, it is well known, always hate each other
cordially as ever fox and wolf; ’tis always between
them, who shall have the fattest share of church
booty! Nay, then, are you so simple? Have you
looked at that smooth cheek, those rich curls?
Why, ’tis the most piquant matter—some Fair
Audacity in disguise! No more Vidame than your
lordship’s self; but, believe me, some cosy little
chanoinesse, sheltering her gentle lapses under the
comfortable wing of Mother Church.”—“Hearken
to Follett and his follies!” interposed a third, a
frank-faced youth, the sap of whose English generous
common-sense had not yet been withered by courtly
poisons. “Nay, neither envoy nor canoness, my
lords, but as tough a youth as ever I came across.
I tried a fall with him, in the Cockpit,—having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
heard him brag of a trick of Breton wrestling,—and
by my soul, the lad is steel and bow-string;
he had me on my back in a twinkling and jeered at
me till, for a moment, I saw him in red! But I
like the lad; he has mettle, for all his whey face.
Heard you not what his Majesty calls him: his
Little Satan!—Old Rowley hath some bit of devil’s
work for him this morning. And that’s the nut of
the mystery.”</p>

<p>“Well, Vidame,” said the King, as soon as they
were out of earshot, “let us now arrange the hour
when we are again to hear your melodious sister
warble, as though she were a bird and found our
dull skies as bright as those of France.”</p>

<p>Enguerrand’s lips trembled. His pale cheek
grew paler still.</p>

<p>But he had by no means been prepared to reveal
his diplomatic failure. His plan was to temporise,
in the hope of eventual success. But his sensitive
acuteness nosed a trail of bitter temper under all
Charles’s urbanity; and, flustered, he hesitated a
second. The King drew his great eyebrows together.</p>

<p>“Madame requires pressing, it seems. She is
perhaps hoarse to-day.”</p>

<p>Enguerrand foresaw how, in another moment, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a gesture of that languid white hand, the insignificant
personality of Jeanne—and with it his own
equally futile existence—would be swept from
Charles’s horizon. Biting his lips, he cast about,
but vainly, in his own brain, for a word which would
keep the King’s fickle humour at least a little longer
on the same bent.</p>

<p>Could she but be brought to take her golden chance,
Jeanne would hold her own against any adversary
but relentless Time—Enguerrand knew his sister
well enough to feel certain of that. So promising
an opportunity, and to see it wrecked by a mood of
monstrous folly!</p>

<p>His eye wandered desperately from the King’s
face, whereon was writ coming dismissal, to the
dull prospect which lay beyond the window: a
leaden river under a leaden sky—merely to see the
huddled, cloaked wayfarers in the boats gliding past
made one shiver.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy’s eyes narrowed; he drew close
to the window, peered eagerly down; nay, he was
not mistaken! Yonder, indeed, went Jeanne …
Jeanne and her woman, and at the water stairs a
boat lay in wait for them. In a flash he understood;
he had been right in his surmise! Moved by an
inspiration born of the very genius for intrigue, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cried eagerly, but under his breath, arresting the
King’s attention even as he was moving wearily
away:—</p>

<p>“Nay, your Majesty, my sister is not hoarse, at
least to my knowledge—I found her not in her
apartment, and now I perceive the reason. The lady
is not hoarse … yet seems like to become so
presently! How will her sweet notes sound, I
wonder, after her water journey, this bitter day!”</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish!” said the King. “What prate is
this, sir?”</p>

<p>Yet, curiosity drew him to approach the window
in his turn. Through the Whitehall water gate,
down the King’s own stairs, a figure, wrapped in a
rose and grey mantle daintily held up to show little
close tripping feet, a small dame was picking her
way down the miry steps. Behind her a waiting
woman in russet carried what appeared to be a lute
case. Charles turned a look, half quizzical, half
interrogative, upon the Vidame.</p>

<p>“And is indeed that pink-and-grey bird our fair
singer of last evening?”</p>

<p>“Even so, sire,” said Enguerrand, bowing low to
conceal the agitation of his countenance.</p>

<p>“Satan, my little friend,” said the King, more
genially, “can you inform me whither she may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
winging her flight, from the very stairs sacred to our
own passage? Not that such ordinance can be
enforced upon birds.”</p>

<p>“I notice, your Majesty,” said Enguerrand, now
turning candid eyes full upon the King, “the skiff
is heading down river. I believe your Majesty’s
Tower lies somewhere in that direction.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said the King. His deep eye lightened
for a second ominously. But as rapidly as it came,
anger vanished from his countenance; and with it
the last traces of his moody, weary humour. “Odd’s
fish!” he ejaculated, “I had forgot! To the Tower,
say you, Vidame? Nay, then, that minds me my
Lord Constable and myself had a merry wager
touching a singing-bird. <i lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, he is early with
the decoy and the lime twig!”</p>

<p>He paused. The Vidame looked at him in astonishment—a
king to wager with a subject! A
king—and to let himself be crossed in his pleasure
and to find in the circumstance food for indulgent
laughter. And the man lodged so conveniently
in his Tower! Joncelle’s vindictive young soul had
been all afire to see the Lord Constable consigned
to one of his own cells. If the Tower of London
was not Charles’s Bastille, for the disposal of inconvenient
courtiers, where was the use of it? If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
king made no use of his prerogatives, where was the
use of royalty?—The Vidame had yet much to
learn.</p>

<p>Pulling his full underlip between finger and thumb,
Charles stared alternately out of the window at the
picture of grey river, vanishing skiff, and brooding
sky, and at Enguerrand’s delicate white face. Beneath
the boy’s tensely still attitude it was easy to
divine quiver of nerves, fierce eagerness.</p>

<p>“Why, now,” said the King at last, somewhat
maliciously, “we are not too proud to be taught by
our subject. Our Lord Constable and ourself had,
as I said, a wager who should capture the linnet’s
next song. My Lord Rockhurst is an old soldier:
he trusts no one. We sent a messenger: we therefore
stand to lose.”</p>

<p>The colour rushed to the Vidame’s face. He
dropped his lids to hide the tears of mortification
that sprang to his eyes. Had the fate of some battle,
the issue of some diplomatic mission, been at stake,
he might almost have felt less keenly the reproach
of his failure. To be King’s Mercury, to set off so
gaily, on so high a flight, and fall so quickly, so
hopelessly—no situation could have been more
exquisitely painful to the Vidame de Joncelles.
(Poor, pious mother! could she have read, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
moment, into the soul of her son, she might well
have thought that the house she had so carefully
kept swept and garnished was indeed invaded by
the seven devils.)</p>

<p>The King’s glance, however, was not unkind.
“Nay, now,” he continued, in ever more good-natured
tones, “all is not lost yet. This infamous
Rockhurst of ours laid too tempting a stake that I
should let him carry off the prize without an effort.
What say you, Little Satan? Have you a mind to see
the Tower? Your great father has been pretty
busy there these five hundred years. It should be
of interest to his little son.”</p>

<p>He flung out his long, careless hand, as he spoke,
toward the boy, and Enguerrand, dropping on one
knee, kissed it with sudden passion. Something
about that hitherto dormant part of his young
anatomy, his heart, was stirred. He had felt himself
dominated by that very carelessness and good
nature against which but a little while ago he had
inwardly railed; caught a hint of a truer royalty in
this careless King than in all the pompous tyranny
of his cousin of France.</p>

<p>Whether the inexplicable Stuart charm, which
Charles, black-visaged, saturnine, cynical as he
was, possessed no less than his romantically beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
father and his handsome, winning brother of York,
had seized the more potently upon Enguerrand’s
nature that had hitherto been brazened in self-conceit
and self-interest against all external influence,
the fact was that in that touch of his lips, the Vidame
de Joncelles devoted himself to a master.</p>

<p>Charles stepped back into the room, called up his
gentleman-in-waiting, and gave instant order for
his barge. As he turned pleasantly then to receive
the <i lang="fr">congées</i> of the dismissed audience, a fine-looking
young man strode quickly into the room, made his
way up, and bowing so low that his profuse, fair
ringlets fell in a cascade on either side of his cheek,
presented a letter for the royal hand. Enguerrand,
standing close, heard the messenger’s murmured
words.</p>

<p>“From Miss Stewart, your Grace.”</p>

<p>The whole circle stepped back and grew wide
while the King read. And many a look of envy was
cast upon the newcomer as Charles, thrusting the
sheet into his breast, turned a complacent countenance
upon him.</p>

<p>“Vastly well, Sir Paul,” said Charles, with a little
nod.</p>

<p>The young man visibly swelled with triumph.
The Vidame’s busy brain worked at high speed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Miss Stewart? That was the great fair girl who gave
the King such cold return for his notice last night.…
Rumour about Court had it, as Enguerrand
knew, that she was playing a high game.…</p>

<p>As a man might look upon one who threatened to
rob him of a mistress’s smile, so Enguerrand glared
at the messenger who had evidently succeeded in
his task. But his own hour was not yet over. In
high good humour, Charles beckoned him again to
his side.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “or we shall be too late. Tide
waits not for kings; and linnets will sing only when
the mood takes them.”</p>

<p class="tb">Enguerrand, seated in the royal barge, felt his
heart swell with pride. He was alone in attendance,
save for the tall officer of guards, whose face, impassive
and dark as bronze over the folds of the red horse
cloak, looked forth with the indifference of the man
under orders, upon this last whim of the master.
The French boy’s blood was tingling with excitement.
The raw airs, the bleak aspect of the waterway,
the shadow of the towering masonry from which they
were just emerging, dark with its story of royal
tragedy, failed to depress a spirit otherwise susceptible
to physical impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>His failure, after all, had become more profitable
than success. He was on sudden terms of intimacy
with a monarch whom he was eager to serve; and
in conjunction with the Stuart himself, he was about
to inflict at least discomfiture upon the man for
whom at first sight he had conceived hatred.</p>

<p>He was still child enough, moreover, to feel a
titillating sense of gratification in watching the skill
and vigour of the royal watermen, the like of which
was undreamed of on French rivers; in feeling that
it was partly for him these stalwart backs bowed in
rhythmic measure, that the oars swept the waters,
green now to his closer vision; that it was, in a way,
before his own passage that the craft hastily opened
out to leave a wide channel, and that every head was
uncovered.</p>

<p>Charles’s face had fallen into its habitual expression
in repose, of somewhat bitter melancholy;
and the journey was traversed in silence, until,
just in front of the archway of London Bridge, the
sweep of the tide, which had been for some time at
the full, began to tell decidedly against them. The
barge came almost to a standstill.</p>

<p>The King roused himself from his abstraction and
flung a rueful smile over his shoulder at Enguerrand:
“Said I not well? The tide waits not for kings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The watermen caught the phrase, and as if stung
in their pride of office fell to at the oars with a fury
which sent the sweat rolling down each weather-beaten
cheek.</p>

<p>“Our wily friend,” proceeded Charles, “chose
his hour with judgment. The bird has as easy a
flight as the dove to the ark. We stand to be beaten,
after all, by my Lord Constable.”</p>

<p>Beaten! Never, if his oarsmen died for it.
The brawny arms shot out in unison; the backs
bent and straightened with the rage of defiance;
they shot the bridge in triumph, the contentious
waters vainly swirling and lapping against the sides
of the barge.</p>

<p>As they emerged into the gentler stream beyond,
there was a moment’s pause, and every man of the
crew, dashing the salt sweat from his eyes, turned
involuntarily toward the royal visage. The slight
smile of approbation on Charles’s lips seemed
ample guerdon for the feat; indeed, as in the case
of most saturnine countenances, its momentary
relaxation had a rare charm. They fell upon the
oars again, and presently the mighty pile of the
Tower seemed to engulf them into its dark shades.</p>

<p>If Whitehall, stained with the blood of a king,
shed a gloom about it, even while holding the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
irresponsible court in the world, what sinister shroud
enveloped these walls to every imaginative mind.
The stones of the dungeon, tradition said, had been
first cemented in lime and blood; and enough blood
had since been poured out within those gates to stain
the moats forever crimson.</p>

<p>The water gates swung back, and the King’s
barge glided in. Charles’s face bore an air of pleasant
anticipation, unwonted good fortune. He was
certain to be amused, whichever way events turned;
certain at least of some novel sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="ENIGMA_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LINNET’S SONG</span></h3>

<p>Jeanne de Mantes sat sidewise in the deep window-seat
of the parlour in the constable’s Tower, her dark
eyes roaming about her with a curiosity not unmixed
with a kind of awe. The room, dark with ancient
oak to its blackened ceiling, with its huge depth of
wall, its aspect of strength, silence, antiquity,
resembled no apartment that she had ever entered.
True, she had never penetrated into the Bastille,
and true, she was here of her own free will and free
to leave at her caprice; yet a small shiver crept over
her. There seemed to her something ominous,
something fated, about the place. All said and done,
it was a prison. What should bring hither those who
lived for freedom and joy?</p>

<p>She glanced almost timidly at the man who stood,
one elbow propped on the embrasure, gazing down
at her with inscrutable yet perhaps mocking eyes.
He matched his Tower, she thought, in the something
dark and melancholy which, though he might smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and court, yet remained as undisturbed as the
sombreness of the room by the leaping firelight or
the early spring flowers on the table.</p>

<p>Their glances met. In the light that fell upon her
from grey skies and grey wall, the texture of her face
showed flawless; richly coloured, at once soft and
firm, it glowed like some southern fruit out of the
cold setting. Her lips were parted: forgotten, in
the momentary feeling of strangeness, all the modish
airs and graces of the Louvre. She looked like a
child, Rockhurst thought. He smiled at her, suddenly,
kindly; sat down on the window-seat beside
her and took her little amber-tinted hand in his.</p>

<p>“This is a rude place for such a one as you,” he
said; “and you look about you like some creature
caught against its will. Nay, you shall but sing me
a song, and take your flight again forthwith, if you
so wish it.”</p>

<p>All the woman in her awoke, petulant, displeased.
Chivalry in love, a man who could desire and yet
spare—that was not at all to her French taste.
She drew her hands quickly from his and tossed her
head.</p>

<p>“How so,” she cried in her pretty foreign English.
“Fortwit’ after my song? But now, at once, if
you prefer! Your lordship is quick tired!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>She sprang from the seat as she spoke. But he,
stretching a lazy arm, caught her by her yielding
waist.</p>

<p>“I said, if you wish it, Mignonne. In love I am
no highwayman, but a courteous dealer.”</p>

<p>She feigned to struggle, brushing his cheek with
her curls; then gave him all the candour of her eyes
and the glint of a smile from her wicked lips; upon
which, suddenly, he kissed them.</p>

<p>“Ah! highwayman, after all!” she mocked.</p>

<p>He drew her close to him, laughing silently.</p>

<p>“Milord Constable,” said she, “if one of your
soldiers down there should chance to look up, it is
all over with … your reputation.”</p>

<p>Again he laughed, struck by the audacious humour
of the soft creature within the circle of his arm.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, then, with unexpected gravity,
“my soldiers have long ceased to look up. My
reputation is too well established to be worth looking
to.”</p>

<p>Piqued, she thrust him from her with a quick
gesture. It is one thing to be quickly conquered;
it is another to be classed among the easy conquests.</p>

<p>“You’re insolent, milord!” she said, with out-thrust
lip.</p>

<p>“My pretty one,” he answered her, “anger becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you vastly; but as for myself, I have a preference
for the dimpled smile.”</p>

<p>He let his arm drop from her carelessly. She
stood looking down at him, fascinated, taunted,
uncertain.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” he went on in the same tone, half
condescending, half caressing, “I am much older
than you; I have had experience—life becomes
much pleasanter, its few good hours vastly easier
of discovery, if we agree to take certain things for
granted. And, as example is ever better than preaching,
let us put my theory in practice. I, now, take
it for granted,” as he spoke his fine teeth flashed a
second in a wider smile, “that you are all virtue,
yet that you harbour for my unworthy self an amiable
passion which excuses, nay, commands, a gentle
lapse. You on your side take it for granted that I
am consumed with an ardour unknown hitherto in
my existence. Come, does not that place us instantly
on a delightful footing? And this being so:
why, then, come back to my side.”</p>

<p>She palpitated between fury and the extraordinary
attraction which drew her to him. Her breast heaved,
her eye first lightened, then melted. She took an
unwilling step, then paused. Almost a sob rose in
her throat. In another moment she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
flung herself on his breast, as he sat awaiting her
with that air of amused certainty that was in itself
at once part of his fascination for her and an insult
to her every instinct of pride, when suddenly she
perceived that his eye had become fixed and distant.
The insolent wretch had already dropped her from
his thoughts; she was not worth to him even that
pause of expectation!</p>

<p>Staring through the south window, up the river toward
that gloomy bridge through the arches of which
she had come to him, his attention was absorbed, his
glance had gained a hawk-like keenness; the lines of
his face were set. Whatever he beheld without, it
was something that evoked far keener interest in
him than the woman who had come to his call, in
preference to that of a king. This was too much!</p>

<p>“Adieu, milord,” she cried in a high, strained
voice. But, womanlike, she must see what it was,
without there, on that hideous river, that he was
looking at.</p>

<p>The royal barge, with its standard and pennants,
its flash of scarlet and the long swing of red-and-gold
oars, was already masked under the shadow of the
battlements; nothing but the long stretch of water,
dotted with black craft, met the searching of her
angry eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>What is it, she asked herself; his fair one, in some
well-known boat? Ah! the owner perhaps of that
face in the locket, which even his King was not to
see? What in the name of all decent pride was
Jeanne de Mantes doing here? Yet even as she
moved again to leave him, with what dignity she
might, the incomprehensible being turned to her
again—turned with a smile so winning, a glance so
warm and caressing, a voice so tender, that the
young woman lost her footing on her momentary
plane of dignity, and found herself floundering
again between a tearful desire for surrender and
that hot anger which only a real love is able to
kindle.</p>

<p>“How now! Adieu, say you? From your lips,
sweet, that is a word I hope never to hear.”</p>

<p>“Why should I remain, milord?” she said feebly.
“You care not to keep me.”</p>

<p>“I care so much that I will not let you go.” He
came after her quickly into the room. “Why, you
foolish child, how can you escape from the Tower
so long as its constable means to hold you? Do
you not know, I have but to call a word, and the drawbridge
is raised, the portcullis dropped over the
waterway—that I have the right of imprisonment
here, that there are secret places where I can hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
my wilful prisoners? Nay, sweet one, are we not
well together here?—You shall sing to me!”</p>

<p>Stirred with an emotion which, hitherto only
playing with life, she had never known before, she
murmured, blushing and trembling:—</p>

<p>“Sing! <i lang="fr">Eh, mon Dieu</i>, you hold to it, then?”</p>

<p>“Why,” he answered her, “was it not singing that
you caught my heart?”</p>

<p>Delicately flattered, she suffered herself to be led
to a cushioned seat by the deep hearth; and she
was already stretching out her arms to receive the
guitar, when something in his air struck her quick
apprehension, something at once of eagerness for
her compliance, yet of indifference toward herself.
He shot restless glances toward the window, seemed
to strain his ear as if for some expected signal.
When his eye swept over her, it was with an impatience
other than that of the fond lover. She took
the instrument from his hand, and watched him with
a new, critical closeness as he flung himself upon the
settle opposite to her.</p>

<p>In a tone which ill concealed irritability, he cried
to her:—</p>

<p>“Begin—begin, little bird!”</p>

<p>Here was some odd mystery. She folded her
hands across the polished olive-wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens!” she exclaimed, and it was her turn
now to mock. “What a passion for music has your
lordship!”</p>

<p>His eye shot anger upon her, beneath contracted
brow. She felt at last that she had power, and her
smile widened.</p>

<p>“You and your song,” said he, “are inseparable.
By your graciousness I hold you mine for a little
while, nor will I be defrauded of any of the sweetness
you can give.”</p>

<p>The words seemed charmingly chosen; but again
the underlying, unknown purpose was perceptible.
A quick inspiration came to her: here was the
moment to bargain; and Enguerrand, the little
impertinent one, should know of her easy triumph
before this grey English day had turned to the
murky English night.</p>

<p>“If I sing,” she said, “I must have my guerdon.”</p>

<p>Amusement and relief sprang together into his
look:—</p>

<p>“Nay, then, pretty one; make your own terms.
Pearls for those shell-like ears—gems for that
throat—”</p>

<p>She shook her head till the ringlets danced.</p>

<p>“Speak, then,” he went on impatiently. “What
jewel, what bauble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>She bent forward with a new, adorable softness,
coaxing.</p>

<p>“A mere trifle, indeed, milord. I but ask for that
locket of yours with which you were pleased to excite
the curiosity of Whitehall last night.”</p>

<p>“How now!” said Rockhurst. He started, and
turned the lightning of his glance, the thunder-cloud
of his brow, upon her, a man whom it was not good
to offend, and she quailed an instant. Then her
hot blood rose in jealous passion:—</p>

<p>“So vastly precious? Why, then, generous milord
Constable, suppose I put a high price upon my
song; are you so ungallant?”</p>

<p>“Little madame,” retorted he, drily, “since you
set a price on your favour, you would be as vastly
disappointed with this poor trinket as Eve with the
taste of her apple. Continue to desire it,” he went
on, falling back into his tone of light cynicism.
“To long for anything unattainable is one of the
spices of existence.”</p>

<p>The firelight leaped on her angry face. She sprang
to her feet, dashing aside the guitar, which fell on
the stone floor with sonorous wail.</p>

<p>“If I could flatter myself I was helping to provide
milord’s tedium with such a spice,” she cried, “my
immediate departure would have a double charm!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus3">

<p class="caption">She felt at last that she had power.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>She reached a trembling hand toward her cloak.
He, outstretched on the settle, watched her, without
moving. At this moment, grave sounds, a trumpet
call, followed by dull roll of kettledrum, rose from
without into the momentary silence of the room.
Stone wall and vault gave back the echo. There
was a hurried tramp of feet, sharp cries of command.
The Frenchwoman’s hand was arrested in mid-air.
She looked in startled query at her host, who was
slowly gathering his long limbs together preparatory
to rising. He met her glance with one that struck
her excited fancy as sinister, and she gave a cry like
a child:—</p>

<p>“Let me out of this horrible place! You have no
right to keep me here!”</p>

<p>He caught her wrist with a grasp gentle yet relentless.</p>

<p>“Your password, Jeanne, shall be a song—however
short, but one stave, a few notes! Your song
I must have!”</p>

<p>He picked up the guitar, and again pressed it upon
her. She put her hand to her throat with a sob,
flung a piteous glance around her like a trapped thing,
and struck a faltering chord. Then, in a sudden revulsion,
her courage rose again.</p>

<p>“Pah!” she cried, “’tis out of tune! <i lang="fr">Eh, bien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
non!</i> I will not sing! I am French; you have
no right to hold me here!”</p>

<p>“By the Lord!” said Rockhurst, a gleam of
genuine admiration leaping to his eye, “but I like
your spirit! Be dumb, then, sweetheart. You
shall pay me by and by. Nay,” he added, smiling
on her bewilderment, “let thy mantle lie where it
is; for, prithee, I would have thee assist me to receive
his Majesty.”</p>

<p>“His Majesty?” she cried, in fresh amazement.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he laughed. “Didst not hear the royal
tucket sound without? Charles in person, who
always finds the world but a dull place, even under
the same roof with an old friend, if there be not the
flutter of a petticoat to liven it. But you have made
me dally, little Madame Mischief, and even my
indulgent monarch expects some pretence of ceremony.”</p>

<p>His hand was on the bolt of the latchet as he spoke;
his last words were almost lost in the echoes of the
vaulted passage.</p>

<p class="tb">Charles paused on the threshold, his sallow face
seeming darker than usual in the grim light. His
lips smiled, but there was a certain displeasure in
his eye as it roamed from Jeanne’s crimsoning countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to the guitar on the seat. From the gloom
of the passage Enguerrand’s white face shone out,
composed save for the deep reproach of his glance
when it met that of his sister. Rockhurst alone,
bowing the King into his apartment, wore a pleasant
air of unconcern.</p>

<p>“We verily believe our visit is inopportune,” said
Charles, with sarcastic courtesy. “We have interrupted,
we fear, some dulcet music, my Lord Constable?”</p>

<p>Rockhurst closed the heavy door behind his
guests, then advanced to the King’s side.</p>

<p>“Nay, sire,” said he, with fine geniality, “the bird
came to the lure, it is true, but no art of mine or
persuasion could call forth a song.… Your
Majesty, no doubt, will prove more successful.”</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish!” cried Charles, with one of his rare,
hearty laughs. “Say you so, indeed, invincible
Constable? Say you so, indeed, my merry Rockhurst?
Beaten? And under such auspices—alone
with your fair! But how, then, are we to put our
own skill now to the test, before so many witnesses?
For we would not win our wager on the royal authority,
but in all equality, my good Lord Constable,
even as in that merry moment we entered upon it.”</p>

<p>Wager? Here, then, was the word of the riddle!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
A wager between two irresponsible men of pleasure:
who should first obtain of a woman the petty guerdon
of a song! ’Twas for that she had been wooed
by both—both! And she, who had been uplifted
on a wave of magnanimous feeling, who had
flattered herself to be giving up a king for the love of
a subject! Jeanne de Mantes had grown white to
the lips. She caught at the table behind her for
support, yet never had her wits been clearer. To
sing for neither would serve them both well. Aye,
but to sing for Charles would best punish him who
had deepest offended. She flung one look of fury at
Rockhurst, and then turned to the King, who had let
himself sink upon the settle in front of the fire:—</p>

<p>“May the poor object of your Majesty’s wager
inquire what are the stakes that were set upon her
favour?” she asked, with a deadly sweetness, taking
up the guitar and beginning to tune it with little,
fierce hands.</p>

<p>Charles, who saw himself on the point of success,
answered thoughtlessly, with a schoolboy look of
triumph at the constable:—</p>

<p>“I but bargained for a sight of the contents of
that mysterious locket which was so contumaciously
denied to my curiosity last night, and—” Then he
hesitated, with a faint flush of confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“His Majesty,” said Rockhurst, gravely, “with his
usual magnanimity, opposed a large guerdon to my
trifling stake.”</p>

<p>The King, both spared and taunted by this
reminder, moved uneasily on his seat. But already
the twang of the guitar in harmonious cadence
brought his light humour back to amusement again.
If hesitation had still lurked in Jeanne’s mind, the
first mention of the locket had swept it away. Her
voice rose, robbed perhaps of some of its delicate
sweetness, but vibrating with unwonted fire and
incisiveness. She chose a bellicose ditty, which
a Frondeuse mother had sung to her baby ears.
And when she paused, panting, on the last refrain,
with a furious sweep across the strings, Charles
broke into delighted applause. Enguerrand, flushing
with triumph, caught the guitar from his sister’s
hand, as with a hysterical gesture she was about
to cast it on the floor.</p>

<p>“I have sung!” she cried loudly, with almost a
viperine movement, rising from the seat on which
she had crouched to play. “Milord Rockhurst
has lost his wager. Let him now pay!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst bowed urbanely toward her, drew the
locket from its hiding-place, and with a second profound
obeisance, handed it, open, to the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
As he looked, the mischievous curiosity on Charles’s
face changed to an expression of profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish!” he cried.</p>

<p>He shot a lightning glance at Enguerrand, then
at his Lord Constable, and then at the picture again.
And once more his expressive countenance altered.</p>

<p>“Yours?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty,” said Rockhurst.</p>

<p>Charles’s eye remained pensive for a further span.
But suddenly it wandered to the Frenchwoman,
and the mercurial King burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“Odd’s my life, but look at your sweetheart, my
lord! The wench is on the very coals of jealousy—a
live trout in the frying-pan were in comfort compared
to her. Nay, we’ll have no torture in our
presence. Fain would you look at your rival,
madame?”</p>

<p>Rockhurst made no effort to interfere, and with
trembling fingers Jeanne took the trinket from the
King’s hand. In her turn she gave a cry; and
Charles laughed heartily at the amazement, relief,
and disappointment of her air.</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis naught but a boy!”</p>

<p>“Naught but a boy, indeed,” echoed Charles,
“yet, we’ll go warrant what our Lord Constable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
holds dearest upon earth. A likely lad! Aye, and
with a strange resemblance to Little Satan there.”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” ejaculated Rockhurst.</p>

<p>And “God forbid!” echoed Enguerrand, pertly,
sharp as lightning.</p>

<p>Charles, who had been in high good humour,
flung the lad a cold look, under which he fell back
abashed and crimsoning—only to glance up again
with a spasm of anger and hatred at the Lord
Constable, as soon as the sovereign’s head was
averted.</p>

<p>“We knew you had an heir,” said the King; then,
turning with dignity to his host, “but, my lord Rockhurst,
you have let us forget it. How is it? He
should be at our Court.”</p>

<p>Bowing deeply, Rockhurst answered in a low
voice:—</p>

<p>“My son is brought up in the country, sire.”</p>

<p>“Nay, fie!” said Charles. “Is not that even what
we would reproach you with? So fair a stripling
should never grow a mere rustic. We’ll have him
about us,” insisted the King.</p>

<p>Again there was that moment’s silence. Jeanne
looked up from the picture at which she had been
absently gazing. This son of Rockhurst interested
her not at all; not had he been twice as handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as the fair, spirited face, with its odd resemblance of
features and its odder dissimilitude of expression
to her own brother. She felt humiliated to have
played so foolish a part of jealousy, and more than
ever baffled by the strange personality of the man
she had elected to love.</p>

<p>Rockhurst took back the locket, gazed at it again,
closed it, and replaced it on its chain.</p>

<p>“Will your Majesty forgive me,” said he, at
length, “nor deem me ungrateful if, in spite of your
condescension, I yet hold that my son is best in the
country?”</p>

<p>“We would at least hear your reason,” said Charles,
with some weariness.</p>

<p>“In the country, your Majesty,” replied Rockhurst,
then, “my lad will continue to revere his
father, to honour womanhood, to live wholesomely
… and think purely.”</p>

<p>Charles’s swarthy cheek became suddenly impurpled
under a pulse of anger.</p>

<p>“And at our Court can your paragon practise
none of these virtues?”</p>

<p>Rockhurst turned his glance deliberately upon
the Vidame de Joncelles, who stood behind the King,
his handsome chin uptilted, his eyes insolently ready
to return the constable’s gaze; then he swept a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
look upon Jeanne de Mantes. That look said more
eloquently than words the thought that was in the
father’s brain. Then, at last, he spoke:—</p>

<p>“Let me remind your Majesty of a phrase you
made use of last night—‘And he, her brother, the
Little Satan!’”</p>

<p>The corners of Charles’s lips twitched humorously
at the recollection; his transient anger evaporated.
It was the misfortune of his life that he was always
most prone to see the light side of the most serious
questions.</p>

<p>Enguerrand, with his implike quickness, caught
the relaxation of the royal profile, and his own lips
quivered with mirth. Upon Rockhurst’s face came
an expression of disdain mingled with deep melancholy.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty smiles,” said he, “and so does the
lad yonder. Ah, your Majesty, look at him! ’Tis
a fine lad, even as my own. And you are right!
there is some resemblance, a great resemblance,
between them; and your Majesty, who saw me
start at it last night, deemed I had seen a spectre.
I saw this, sire—what a court makes of
youth.”</p>

<p>Charles’s foot had been tapping restlessly. He
moved once or twice uneasily in his chair: his merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Rockhurst had not used him to such wearisome
moods. Yet he loved the man.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” he explained at length; “I’d have
you remember, my lord, that it is my cousin of
France who is responsible for our Little Satan yonder.
Nay, Rockhurst,” he went on, in his easy kindness
and his sense of royal prerogative, unable to grasp
the fact that any one could be in earnest in refusing
the favour of his personal interest; “I’ll have the
lad with my own sons. We’d keep our eye upon
him, man.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst’s glance rested on the King’s countenance
now with an unwonted tenderness.</p>

<p>“Alas, my beloved liege! …” he said gently.</p>

<p>Their gaze commingled; then the amazed displeasure
in Charles’s eyes gave place to unwilling
amusement, as Rockhurst went on once more in
his usual indifferent tone:—</p>

<p>“The poor child would at least, your Majesty
will admit, find it hard to practise at Court the fourth
commandment.… How should he honour his
father? And yet ’tis my wish that his days should
be long in the land.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said the King, shortly, “there is no
more to be said.”</p>

<p>He rose and looked a second keenly at Jeanne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Then, upon one of those generous impulses which
none could carry more gracefully into effect than
himself:—</p>

<p>“You lost your wager to me, my lord, with all the
gallantry I expected of so good a cavalier. But,
Odd’s fish! I do not carry away altogether a clear
conscience on the subject. If you have lost in the
letter, it strikes me you have won in the spirit. I
will take it, if you please, that we have both won;
I will indite forthwith an order on the exchequer
for those greedy yeomen of yours who contrive to be
always under arrears of pay.… Though, upon
my life, Rockhurst, you and your fellows put me
in mind of those callow birds we used to watch, in
our wandering days: it boots little how big the last
mouthful—ever a squawk for more!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst folded his lips upon the obvious retort.
He took the sheet from the King’s hand with an air
of profound obligation:—</p>

<p>“Your Majesty’s veterans will be deeply gratified.”</p>

<p>But already Charles was weary of the subject,
weary of his present company.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, bowing toward Jeanne as he
hastily got up, “we shall importune you no longer
with our presence.”</p>

<p>The little Frenchwoman understood very well that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in these words all royal pretensions to her favour
were finally abandoned, and, in her infatuation for
Rockhurst, cared as little for the fact as for the furious
look cast upon her afresh by Enguerrand.</p>

<p>“Come, Vidame,” said the King. Then he added,
with a malicious gesture that pointed from Jeanne
to Rockhurst, “Come, you are as much out of place
in this atmosphere of virtue as ourself!”</p>

<h2>THE PEACOCK WALK</h2>

<h3 id="PEACOCK_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">JUNE ROSES</span></h3>

<p>The peacock, picking his stilted way along the
lower terrace walk, conscious of his magnificence
with the sunshine on his burnished breast, rejoiced
at the sound of approaching steps: here, at last, was
some one to see and to admire.</p>

<p>But in vain did Juno’s bird spread and parade,
advance and retreat, and display for the newcomers
the glories of his outspread tail, which defied the
sun with its fifty iridescent eyes. The elder of
the two young men interrupted but for a second an
emphatic speech to cast an indifferent glance upon
the strutting splendour; while the younger poked
at it idly with the stock of his whip. Offended,
and with discordant protest, the peacock flapped on
to the stone lion that heraldically guarded the terrace
stairs and swept over their heads the fall of his
unappreciated train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe, the emphatic speaker, turned to
survey with sullen eyes the scene which spread away
beneath the balustrade of the Peacock Walk. It
was the ripest hour of an early June day. The
wood-crowned slopes, dropping down from the
garden, were bathed in mellow light. Farther
away, rich pastures, gently swelling into knolls,
melted into purple haze, until they were gathered
into the distant amethystine moors. Almost as far
as the eye could reach, the land and all that stood
on it—timber, meadow, homestead, hamlet—belonged
to Rockhurst, fit appanage to those massy
castle walls that rose clear-cut against the blue air,
in all the majesty of ancient power. And as he
gazed, Lionel Ratcliffe’s heart grew sombre even as
his glance. A keen-faced man, old-looking for his
thirty years, somewhat below the middle height,
with marked features, cold blue eyes and thin lips
that betrayed the working of an intellect as sharp
as the steel that hung by his side.</p>

<p>His companion was of vastly different stamp.
Country bumpkin was written on the face of Edward
Hare, on every seam of his oversmart suit; country
wits stared from his prominent eye, were heralded
by the laugh ever ready upon his mouth—a mouth,
one dared swear, that had known no better taste in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
life than the rim of an ale can, the hard cheek of
some bouncing Dorcas.</p>

<p>Waking from his abstraction, Ratcliffe wheeled
upon his cousin, and resumed his indictment:—</p>

<p>“It is even as I tell you,” quoth he. “They are
both as apt as tinder: it needs but a spark now to
set the glow. ’Slife, Ned, I little thought thine
would be the hand to strike flint!”</p>

<p>“Mine, Cousin Lionel?” broke in the other,
whining. “Nay, nay—”</p>

<p>But the first, flinging out an accusing forefinger,
bore down the plaintive interruption:—</p>

<p>“Then why didst bring her over here to-day?—Come
now, ’tis plain enough. Dost favour my suit,
or young Rockhurst’s?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know I’ll have none but you,” bellowed
Edward Hare. “Harry Rockhurst …?”
he cried. “Phew!”</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers and blew through them,
threw himself into an attitude of defiance and, so
doing, stumbled into his new-fangled sword which,
carry it at whatever angle he tried, seemed ever in
his way. Ratcliffe steadied his kinsman, then,
still holding him by the elbow, drew him toward the
stone bench, overhung by climbing roses. Having
jerked his companion down upon it, he let himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
subside beside him, crossed his legs and proceeded,
contemptuously, good-humoured yet incisive:—</p>

<p>“If I wed Mistress Harcourt, your sister, is’t
not a bargain? Shalt not continue to have bed and
board and bottle beneath her roof? Aye, and many
more of old Harcourt’s round pieces to chirp in thy
pockets at cockfight and hammer fair? And when
we go to Whitehall …” He paused impressively.</p>

<p>Edward Hare was touched; his soft face became
moved as by not distant tears.</p>

<p>“Good Lionel … dear coz! Odd’s babers!
Do I not tell thee thou shalt have her?”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe resumed, casting his words into space
with a sidelong watchfulness as to their effect.</p>

<p>“Whereas, mark, if Diana wed another, what of
thee, then, my cock? ’Tis back to the bare ancestral
acres with Sir Edward Hare. ’Tis farthing toss and
small ale. For thou art poor, lad, damned poor!
And a poor baronet—fie!”</p>

<p>The poor baronet made a wry face. He pushed
his plumed hat off his forehead to scratch his perplexed
head.</p>

<p>“Aye, small ale, plague on it! Farthing toss—pooh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Twill ne’er do, eh, Ned!” laughed the other.</p>

<p>“No, split me, ’twill ne’er serve a man like me!”</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hare rose, in his indignation, and
promptly tripped again over his sword. Somewhat
abashed, and trying the comfort of a new angle,
he dropped his high tone once more for one of
plaint:—</p>

<p>“But, Lord, coz, what can I do? Di is like the
bay filly: she’ll neither lead nor drive. Ain’t I
always a-singing your praises? ‘There’s the husband
for you, Di,’ say I. ‘There’s the lad for me,’
say I, twenty times a day.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe cursed his cousin in secret, as, rising in his
turn, he clapped him affectionately on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I marvel at you,” he bantered. “And will you
walk your filly to the gate and expect her to take it on
the standstill? Is that the way to deal with a woman?
Shouldst say to her: ‘Hast noticed Cousin Lionel’s
squint?… Prithee, sister, have ne’er a thing to
do with Cousin Lionel: ’tis a sad bad man! Ah,
there are tales, sister, terrible tales!’”</p>

<p>Edward gaped.</p>

<p>“Oh, and what will she do then?”</p>

<p>“Why, look into mine eyes the very next time;
and, not finding the squint, perhaps find something
else, something in them she never marked before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The young oaf nodded portentously.</p>

<p>“Aye,” cried he, “and then—”</p>

<p>“And then—Why, I see you take me. Hast
sharp wits, coz!—Then will she begin to ponder
on those dark deeds of mine, and wonder about
Cousin Lionel, and think him a very different man
after all from the kinsman who played with her and
teased her all her life. But, zounds, man, such a
cock of the walk as thou art need not be lectured on
the art of love! Why, when we get that figure of
thine to Court, what a stir will there be among the
beauties!”</p>

<p>The poor youth made no attempt to disguise his
flattered emotion.</p>

<p>“Ecod,” he smirked, looking down at his legs,
“I’ll not say but I can hold my own among the
petticoats. He, he—a word in thine ear, Lionel:
Moll, you know—” he whispered into his cousin’s
curls, laughing immoderately. “And little Prudence
Prue, down at the Red Lion—” Here he whispered
again and guffawed: “Odd’s babers, she did! But
Di must not hear of it.”</p>

<p>With immovable gravity, the elder man submitted
to these boisterous confidences; then, holding
his cousin from him at arm’s length, surveyed him
with an irony which must have pierced through
anything less thick-skinned:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a blade you are! There will be no holding
you at Whitehall!”</p>

<p>He suddenly sighed, dropped his hands, shook his
head, and assumed a tone of melancholy:—</p>

<p>“Heigho, but we must get thee to Court first!
And these adieus will undo all. ’Slife, man, she’s
ripe for love. ’Tis rebound, ’tis nature. After the
cold fit, the hot one. After old Harcourt, the old
husband promptly and happily demised, Harry
Rockhurst the stripling, live and young!…
After eighty, eighteen.…”</p>

<p>“Nay,” interrupted Edward, sapiently. “Harry
Rockhurst is twenty.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” mused Lionel, “and so is our pretty Di.
Lord! your worthy mother had scarce called out,
‘Oh,’ of Diana, before my Lady Rockhurst began
her, ‘Ah,’ of that young whelp! Well, by this time,
these babes will have plighted their troth, if the
gods interfere not.” He turned on Hare, his fierce
temper escaping him for an unguarded moment:
“Why the foul fiend did you let her ride over here
to-day?”</p>

<p>Ned swelled with dudgeon.</p>

<p>“I? How could I prevent it, pray?”</p>

<p>“Poor numskull, how couldst thou?” echoed the
other, half aside.—“Well, well, I fear me, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
caught in my own springe! They might have
philandered all summer and naught have come of
it.… But I must needs work upon Grandam
Chillingburgh, persuade her to summon the naughty
grandchild in all haste from a bad match—and
’tis the parting will ruin all!”</p>

<p>He paused, biting his lip over vexed thoughts.
Then his alert ear caught the fall of distant footsteps.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, starting, “yonder they come!
Let us to the upper terrace, Ned, and watch them
from above.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward, who had been endeavouring to hit
a bumblebee with his whip, and was lost in the
excitement of the sport, burst into a roar of self-applause
at an unexpectedly successful stroke:—</p>

<p>“Saw you that? I hit him. I hit him!… A
great bumblebee!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe clenched his hand, exasperated. Then,
recalling his self-control, shrugged his shoulders,
caught his cousin by the arm, and marched him
determinedly toward the upper terrace stairs.</p>

<p class="tb">The two whose doings were exciting so much
interest in Lionel Ratcliffe’s mind, came slowly
along the Peacock Walk and halted beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
watchers: a pair so well-matched in youth and
looks as well to justify apparently the jealous kinsman’s
fears.—Harry Rockhurst, stripling just
hardening into manhood, keeping some of his boy
graciousness in the virility of the newer stage, sunburnt,
vigorous; with brown curls tossed back from
a broad forehead, and brilliant hazel eyes, keen and
bold of vision, as should be those of the noted follower
of hounds and hawk: by his side, as tall
nearly as her cavalier, Diana Harcourt, the young
widow, radiant with the sun on her auburn hair!</p>

<p>As her lover spoke to her, she listened, not unwillingly,
and her glance rested on his face with
pleasure. Yet there was something well-nigh maternal
in this complacence which might have bidden
him pause.</p>

<p>“Diana,” the boy cried passionately, “you must
hear me; I will speak.”</p>

<p>She moved a pace from him and, sitting down on
the bench, drew a hanging branch of wild rose to
the wild rose of her cheek.</p>

<p>“The last of my country flowers,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Stay,” he exclaimed. “Let me pluck you a
posy!”</p>

<p>High over their unconscious heads, Lionel Ratcliffe,
peering cautiously over the balustrade, had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sneer for the childish eagerness. But Diana took
the flowers with a simple grace.</p>

<p>“Thank you, and thank you.… Nay, how
sweet they are! And to think that to-morrow
evening we shall be so far away. ’Tis hard to leave
the garden for the town.”</p>

<p class="tb">(“Mark you, now,” whispered Ratcliffe overhead,
nipping Hare by the arm, “and take a lesson
in Dan Cupid’s ways. ’Twill be: ‘Think of me,
and do not forget me!’ And a prate of hopes, and
a whisper of pledges. And then the word will hop
out like a hot coal, Love! and their little world will
be all ablaze—And ’twill be Love … Love …
Love, and everything lost if some one be not at hand
to spray cold water at the right moment.”</p>

<p>“The garden can?” suggests the practical Ned,
in a mouthing undertone.</p>

<p>“Hush! lad,” murmured the other, “hast yet to
learn metaphor. Nay—hark! Not a breath, on
thy life.”)</p>

<p class="tb">“I shall dream, I think, of the gardens of Rockhurst,”
Diana was saying.</p>

<p>“The gardens?” echoed Harry. He was leaning
against the wall, by the bench, looking down at her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bending close. “Gardens? Is that all you regret,
Mistress Harcourt?”</p>

<p>“Fie,” smiled she, “I am not so ungrateful.
Shall I not regret my friends, my neighbours, good
Mistress Rockhurst, and yourself?”</p>

<p>The boy drew back and straightened himself,
galled to the quick.</p>

<p>“My aunt—and me! Truly, I am, madam, I
am proud.” He flung himself away, his shoulder
turned ostentatiously on Diana. She laughed with
indulgence; then sighed. And, in heart-broken
fashion, Harry caught up the sigh.</p>

<p class="tb">(“First stage, sighs,” reflected the watcher.
“’Tis most harmless.”)</p>

<p class="tb">Young Rockhurst’s dudgeon was not of long
duration. He edged along the wall to the bench and
bashfully took seat.</p>

<p>“So ends the year,” he said softly, “that brought
me the happiness of paradise—Diana.”</p>

<p>“Master Rockhurst.…”</p>

<p>“Must it end thus?” Suddenly bold, he tried to
take the fair hand idly clasping the posy.</p>

<p>“Take care, sir,” she cried mischievously, “there
are thorns here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah,” he breathed, “so that I might gather the
roses.…”</p>

<p class="tb">(And above their heads, Lionel Ratcliffe: “Second
stage: hand-clasps and protestations. Next
will come kneeling work, and next the lips.—Wary
now, for it goes rapidly!”)</p>

<p class="tb">“Pray you, pray you, Harry!” Diana chid,
endeavouring gently to free her hand.</p>

<p>But the boy had slipped the leash of his ardour
and was not to be hushed.</p>

<p>“O my sweet life, hear me, hear me!”</p>

<p>“I vow,” she said, half rebuking, “I never knew
you in this mood!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I am bold,” he panted. “Must I not be
bold indeed for that I dare to love you!” Saying
which, he fell on both knees before her.</p>

<p class="tb">(“Is’t not time to stop them?” whispered Hare
into Ratcliffe’s ear. “I could drop a little stone on
sister Di’s head.”</p>

<p>“Soft,” interposed the other, with his contemptuous
patience. “Let the children play a little while
longer; ’twill be the finer sport to slip in ’twixt cup
and lip!”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, Ratcliffe was beginning to suspect that
he had overrated Harry Rockhurst’s influence. If he
knew women, his fair cousin, below yonder, had
given no real response. He had caught the note of
indulgence which the wooer himself was too inexperienced
to mark in her accents. True, there
might lurk some danger even in this; yet not such
as to call for indiscreet interference. He smiled
sardonically as the lover’s pleading rose passionately
in the air.</p>

<p class="tb">“Give me hope, Diana—one word. Ah, madam,
give me hope!”</p>

<p>But Mistress Harcourt rose and disengaged herself
with some decision from the young man’s
grasp.</p>

<p>“Stay, Master Rockhurst, how can I listen to
you? In truth, dear lad, you are over young to
dream of such matters yet. Why, and what would
my Lord Rockhurst say, could he but hear? Indeed,
Harry, ’tis undutiful of you, without your
noble father’s sanction—I dare swear without even
his knowledge.”</p>

<p>“My father!” cried the boy, as if the words had
struck him. “Alack,” he added despairingly, “this
sudden departure, upon which you have resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
has thwarted all my plans. Yet, madam, you are
wrong; my father does know. I have writ him all
my heart.”</p>

<p>Diana turned the pale, fresh beauty of her face full
in surprise upon the speaker.</p>

<p>“Aye—have you, indeed?” cried she. “And
what says his lordship?”</p>

<p>The youth, emboldened afresh, pressed forward;
but she kept him sweetly at arm’s length, menacing
him with her posy.</p>

<p>“He has not answered yet—could not have
answered yet, madam. Natheless, I am his only
child; he loves me: there can be but one answer.
Diana, if that be all that stands between us—”</p>

<p>“Nay,” she teased, “and shall I tell you your
father’s answer? ‘Ah, Harry’ (will his lordship say),
‘have I kept thee secluded in the country, that thou
mightest grow strong in health and virtuous in mind’—for
these, we are told, are my Lord Rockhurst’s
reasons—‘and hast seen a young gentlewoman
for the first time? Pack up, lad, pack and ride with
me to London town; and in a week will’t have
forgotten her very existence!’”</p>

<p>“How little you know my father … how
little you know me!” exclaimed the lover, with
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas, child, this is country innocence. Do I not
know something of the ways of the great world!
Your education has not yet begun, all respect to his
lordship’s judgment. When he has shown you the
Court, the town, the quality—”</p>

<p>Harry Rockhurst interrupted her with a vexed
laugh:—</p>

<p>“The Court, the town, the quality—why,
madam, he will not even tell me of them. ’Tis only
his duty as Captain of the King’s Yeomen and Constable
of the Tower that keeps him from living here
among us—the only life he deems worthy of a true
gentleman: that of the owner on his estates. London,
he says, is contamination. Therefore keepeth
he me here, though it part him and me.”</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head:—</p>

<p>“And how shall I find favour in the eyes of this
strict gentleman?” she said, in the same fond tone
of mockery. “I who am gay, and think not so ill
of the town, and have no mind for sad faces and dull
clothes! I fear me, Harry, your father is at heart a
puritan!”</p>

<p>“My lord a puritan,” cried the boy, in fine scorn—“the
King’s own private friend in exile, the hero
of Worcester’s evil day … why, Diana, villainous
Noll set a higher price on my father’s head than upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
any other in England, save his most gracious
Majesty’s own—sweet Mistress Harcourt, if that
were your only fear—”</p>

<p>Greatly daring, he flung out his arm to encircle
her. Swayed by his artless passion, Mistress Harcourt
suffered the embrace, but it was with a kind of
friendly tolerance.</p>

<p>A loud shout from above drove them apart.</p>

<p>“Cousin Di!—where can she be? Cousin Di,
Master Rockhurst…!”</p>

<p>There was Lionel Ratcliffe, on the terrace above
them, shouting into space through the hollow of
his hands; and beside him Edward Hare, consumed
with laughter.</p>

<p>Young Rockhurst stamped his foot; but Diana
(not displeased, perhaps, at the interruption) glanced
calmly up.</p>

<p>“Here I am, Cousin Lionel—and here, as you
can see, is Harry.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe leant across the balustrade, wiping his
face as though heated.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I have sought for you!” he called.</p>

<p>“So it seems,” retorted she, ironically, “with
apparently never a thought to cast a glance over the
wall.”</p>

<p>He grinned. She was the dearer to him for her
sharp wits, and for a tongue that was even a match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
for his own. But what answer he would have made
was lost in a new interruption: the sound of a postboy’s
horn rose swelling through the quiet airs,
and almost immediately the bell clanged from the
castle’s gate. Then came calls, shouts, and rumours.
Ratcliffe straightened himself from his
leaning posture:—</p>

<p>“What have we here?” he cried. “Ha—Mistress
Alicia!”</p>

<p>A stout, elderly lady appeared at the head of the
terrace steps.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam, a moment,” said Harry to
Diana, and ran to meet his aunt. The lady was
beckoning with great energy:—</p>

<p>“News, lad, news from your noble father, from
my dear brother!” She turned on the second step
and raised her voice (never a soft one) in vigorous
expostulation to some hidden person: “Hither,
fellow, hither, thou laggard, and commend thee for
a lazy loon!”</p>

<p>Stirred by these expostulations the postboy, covered
with dust and sweat, emerged upon the terrace
above at a limping run. Harry bounded up the steps
to snatch a letter from his hands. He broke the
seal and gave a cry of joy:—</p>

<p>“These are news indeed! My father will be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
us to-night, nay, toward the fifth hour afternoon,
so he writes.—Rascal, you have tarried indeed!—In
good truth, these are news!”</p>

<p>His joyful exclamations were lost in a deep outburst
of lamentation from Mistress Rockhurst.</p>

<p>“To-day!” quoth she, clapping her palms together.
“Murrain take me, if these be not the ways
of men! Gilian! Basil!—get thee to the buttery,
knave!—Robin! … Robin! the flag!”</p>

<p>But the excellent housewife was not of those who
waste their energies upon mere speech. As hastily
as her bulk would permit, she was already hying
her way back toward the castle. And the clamour
of her voice was lost behind the yew hedges. Harry
bent over the parapet, calling to Diana, who stood
pensively where he had left her.</p>

<p>“Give me joy, madam; my father will be here
instantly!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe brushed past him and came down the
steps toward his kinswoman. He laid a hand
upon her arm, and looking toward his host:—</p>

<p>“Then,” cried he, “shall we leave you to your
filial transport.” He dropped his voice, to continue
maliciously, in the young widow’s ear: “Di, what
says’t thou? Shall we not ride instantly? Gad,
were it but a meeting ’twixt lover and mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
’twere something to wait for—but this business!
‘My worthy father.… My beloved son!’ ’Twas
ever a feast of cold veal, since the days of the prodigal—Though
faith,” he laughed, “’tis the father, here,
comes from the husks to seek the calf at home!”</p>

<p>And while Diana gazed upon his sharp face with
wonder and disfavour, Ratcliffe hailed Rockhurst
once more: “Therefore, I say, good Master Harry,
pray you bid them call up our horses.”</p>

<p>Young Rockhurst protested. But Diana, to
Ratcliffe’s surprise and greatly to his satisfaction,
instantly backed the request:—</p>

<p>“Indeed, Lionel is right; our presence is out of
place at this meeting.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” implored Harry, and ran headlong down
into the Peacock Walk again to catch her hand, “for
pity’s sake … no and indeed no, madam.”</p>

<p>The lady disengaged herself, settled her roses,
gathered her gloves and whip from the bench and
looped her riding skirts. Then she turned, and,
smiling, courtesied:—</p>

<p>“Indeed and indeed, yes, sir! And since farewell
it must be, why, then, farewell!”</p>

<p>She wafted a kiss from her roses toward him.</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” he implored, still endeavouring to arrest
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Slife!” cried Lionel, impatiently looking up.
“There rises the flag … there flies the noble
blazon! Let it be the signal for us. Come Di—go,
hurry the horses, Ned!” he shouted to Hare, who,
astride on the upper balustrade, sat gaping down at
them. “Blessings upon the Rakehell,” he muttered
to himself, as Diana motioned Harry on one side with
decisive gesture.</p>

<p>“Nay, it is good-by,” she was saying.</p>

<p>The boy caught her fingers and the roses together:—</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, will you turn all my joy into sorrow?”</p>

<p>Here the gate-bell clanged again.</p>

<p>“My father,” cried Harry, starting toward the
steps.</p>

<p>“Farewell,” said Diana, “and—”</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” cried the poor lover, distractedly, and
ran back to fling himself once more before her.
“But a few minutes, dearest Diana!”</p>

<p>She hesitated before his distress. Lionel irritably
seized her arm.</p>

<p>“Nay, child, you must come!” The touch, the
tone were overmasterful. She flashed a haughty
look upon him.</p>

<p>“Must! Cousin Lionel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry, seeing his advantage, pressed it ardently.</p>

<p>“Delay but for five minutes! Sure, ’tis not much
to ask!”</p>

<p>“You foolish lad!” said Diana, gently. Then,
smiling into the passionate eyes, “Yet I would not
seem churl to you. And I will even wait these five
minutes in the rose garden yonder. Your arm so
far, an it please you, Lionel. But, I pray you,
remember that there must be no musts from you to
me.”</p>

<p>She moved away with a very stately grace, Lionel,
biting his lips upon a bitter smile, walking at her
side. Harry stood gazing after her as one lost in a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PEACOCK_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">FATHERLY WISDOM</span></h3>

<p>My Lord Rockhurst approached the wall of the
upper terrace and looked down upon his son. His
countenance, naturally grave, and stamped now with
the pallor and fatigue of his lengthy ride, grew
graver as he watched. Beside him, his sister threw
up scandalised hands. But, as she was about to
give voice to her feelings, he arrested her with a
gesture, and went slowly to the top of the stairs.
There he paused and called,—</p>

<p>“Harry!”</p>

<p>The boy started, wheeled round, rushed up the
steps, and dropped on one knee before his father.</p>

<p>“My lord … my dear father!”</p>

<p>Lord Rockhurst raised him, looked a second
keenly at the young face; then laying his hand upon
his shoulder, walked down with him toward the
bench, where, still without speaking, he took seat.
Shaking her head at her nephew, Mistress Rockhurst
followed them at some distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” cried Harry, impetuously, “’tis ten
months and two days since I last beheld your countenance!”</p>

<p>So saying, he was about to cast himself upon his
father’s breast; when, with the faintest motion of
the hand, Rockhurst restrained him.</p>

<p>“And yet, didst show, even now, no undue haste
to greet me. ’Tis the first time, Harry,” he proceeded
in softer tones, “that thou hast failed to welcome
me before the gates.… I had looked forward to
that moment.”</p>

<p>“And indeed, nevvy,” added Mistress Alicia, as
she halted, panting, before him, “’twas not pretty
acted. ‘Where’s Harry?’ says his lordship. And
’twas old Giles held the stirrup, which had been thy
privilege, Harry, since thou wert five years old.”</p>

<p>Blushes chased each other over the boy’s face.
He could but stammer:—</p>

<p>“Oh, sir … oh, father!”</p>

<p>“Nay, no excuses!” bade the Lord Constable.</p>

<p>His son’s cheek grew a darker crimson still.</p>

<p>“The lady, sir,” he murmured, “the lady I wrote
of—”</p>

<p>Mistress Rockhurst snorted with increased indignation,
but Lord Rockhurst was now smiling
dreamily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“A lady! sayst thou?… Boy Harry and his
lady! Nay, then, a petticoat is like charity and must
needs cover a multitude of sins!”</p>

<p>“Petticoats, indeed,” ejaculated under her voice
the irate dame—“The hussy!”</p>

<p>Lord Rockhurst had no thought to spare for his
sister’s opinions just now. Holding Harry at arm’s
length, he surveyed him with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Thou art grown a goodly lad. In faith, well-nigh
a man!”</p>

<p>He drew him into his embrace and held him close
a second. Then, releasing him, fell back with a
sigh of ease upon the bench; flung off his mantle
and unbuckled his sword, both of which Harry
respectfully received from his hand.</p>

<p>The traveller sighed, took off his hat, and ran his
fingers through his hair with the gesture of contented
weariness.</p>

<p>“Another drop of cordial, my lord,” cried his
sister, rising, all eager for service.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said he, motioning her back; “I have all
the cordial I need here, Alicia. Come close, Harry.
Dost know,” proceeded the Lord Constable, as his
son knelt beside him, “dost know I have ridden two
hundred miles these days, with scarce as many
minutes’ rest, to put order into thy business? That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to-morrow I must e’en be jogging back again, for
his Majesty has need of me? Thou presumptuous
rogue!” He struck the lad on the shoulder as he
spoke, and seriousness underlay his tone of banter.
“Wouldst plot to make a grandsire of me already?
Mark those pleading eyes, sister.… Even so
did they look up at me when he stood no higher
than my knee, and it was: ‘Father, John blacksmith
has so fair a pony to sell,’ or ‘Giles vows he
will drown the red setter pup! O father, I want it!’
Aye, child, thou hast a father, and ’tis well for thee!”
His mouth twisted with a light contempt under the
upturned moustache. “A widow!” he said.</p>

<p>“Aye,” put in Aunt Alicia vindictively, “and a
delicate, fine lady to boot.—Ah, nephew, did I not
tell thee his lordship would set order here? What
doth Mistress Harcourt care for still-room or buttery?
Could she brew a bottle of gilly water? Nay—much
less turn thee a pasty—?”</p>

<p>“Peace, peace, sister,” rebuked his lordship.
“Harry—” he turned tender, relentless eyes upon
his son’s quivering face, “thou, who wouldst get
thee to begetting heirs already, what dost thou
know of life?”</p>

<p>The youth rose to his feet, withdrew a pace, and
looked earnestly at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“As much, my lord,” he answered then, “as you
have allowed me to know.”</p>

<p>A moment the elder man seemed struck. He
gazed down at his linked hands and reflected.
Then he, too, got up. It was with an air of
finality:—</p>

<p>“Faith, aptly replied! Therefore, son—” he
took the lad’s arm, “thou must still believe my will
best for thee.”</p>

<p>Harry caught up his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord, God forbid I should even question
the wisdom of your dealings with me! Truly, I
have never hankered after the town; and, if I
have seen you ride forth alone with a heavy heart,
it has only been because of the longing for your
gracious company. But, father—” he clasped his
other hand over the gloved one he held, “she
loves the country, too, let Aunt Alicia say what
she will.” He shot a flaming look of reproach at
the buxom lady. “And … and, we should be
full content to dwell here forever if we were
married, sir.”</p>

<p>“Married!” echoed Rockhurst. He pulled his
hand from his son’s clasp and passed it caressingly
over the beardless chin. “Aye, there’s a cheek for
a husband, truly!” (Mistress Alicia broke into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
good-humoured laughter and struck her knees in
applause.) “When thy beard is grown, we’ll talk
of such matters again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord,” pleaded the lover. “What of
my age?—since you yourself were married when
no older than I am, as our Bible leaf shows. Say
nothing, at least, till you have seen her! She is
here, father, even now, in the rosary! Alack, she
has ridden hither to bid farewell, for to-morrow she
sets out for London town. And, oh, father, may
I not escort her?”</p>

<p>“To London!” exclaimed the father. His face
grew dark with a heavy frown. “To London!
No, sir, not within fifty miles of the Babylon! How
now, art grown so bold?”</p>

<p>“I thought not of the town,” stammered Harry;
“I thought but of the perils of the road for her.”
Then, gaining assurance, he proceeded: “Even
here there is talk of Claud Du Vall and such bold
ruffians. Sir Edward, her brother … Sir Edward,
in truth, is a poor fool, my lord—And Mr.
Ratcliffe, her cousin, who rides with them, him I
mightily mistrust. You have given me your blood,
father—will you blame me now because it
will not run obediently when I think of danger
to my lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, if thy body kept pace with thy spirit,”
mocked Rockhurst, “what a beard wouldst soon
have, my callow son!” Yet, though he mocked,
anger had fled from his glance to be replaced by
fatherly pride.</p>

<p>The tears rose to Harry’s eyes. The young can
endure severity better than irony.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am a child no longer,—I am ever your
dutiful son, sir,—but I cannot give up Diana. My
lord, do but see her; see her now…!”</p>

<p>“Now?” cried the other, surprised. Then recollecting
himself: “True, didst say she was in the
garden.” His eye grew ever more indulgent. “See
her, lad,” he went on, “aye, truly. For what other
purpose had I ridden all these weary miles?”</p>

<p>With the youth, all was once more sunshine,
where, before, there had been but clouds.</p>

<p>“Ah, father, I knew your indulgence would never
fail me. Nay, I will conduct her to you, on the
instant.”</p>

<p>He started to run, as he spoke. Rockhurst
watched the figure out of sight, then laughed low to
himself and turned to his sister.</p>

<p>“I will conduct her to you, on the instant,” he
repeated. “Aha—and doubtless the pretty widow
will come as meekly at his bidding to display herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as ever heifer to the fair. <i lang="la">O rustica simplicitas!</i>”
And laughing, he came back to the bench and sat
down.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lord,” said Mistress Alicia, with as
much disapproval as she dared to show to the head
of the house, “here is no matter for laughing. ’Tis
an excellent thing, my lord, that you should forbid
Harry from marrying the Widow Harcourt. And
truly, as you say, he’s not fit to wed for some four
or five years to come. And, of a certainty, she’s
scarce the woman to manage a household like this,
brother; not such as I should care to trust with the
keys. And I think you’ll not refuse me the credit
to say, brother, that I have become them well these
five years. Since, with his Majesty’s most happy
Restoration, your lordship also has come to
your own again, and placed me at the head of
your house—I trust, I say, I have become the
charge.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, none better,” said Rockhurst, absently.</p>

<p>The lady glanced at him sidelong. Her comely
face took an air of indecision, almost of timidity,
foreign to the massive severity of its lines. Something
she had on her mind, that yet she feared to
utter. But lack of courage could never be the
failing of a Rockhurst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, indeed, my lord, so long as you keep the
lad mewed up here, as if he were a girl, ’tis not to be
expected that he should get rid of such like maggots
in his head. Why, the town’s the place for a gallant
young gentleman like Harry. Your only son, my lord,
your heir! Think on it. Why, Court’s the place
for him, and you so rarely in his Majesty’s favour!
He’d sing another song there, I warrant you.”</p>

<p>Once again the father’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>“’Tis my bird, sister; I’ll have him sing the song
I choose.”</p>

<p>“But surely, brother,” argued the doughty lady,
scarlet in the face, “with you to watch over him,
with your example—”</p>

<p>“With my example!” He turned suddenly and
fiercely on his sister: “No, by the Lord, not even
with such valuable aid as that, will I trust my fine
lad into that sink—that charnel-house—that pit!
Ah, you think yourself so wise, and prate of what
you know not—poor innocent old country virgin.
I tell thee, woman, the taint is in the very air. Eyes,
ears, nay, every pore, are channels for the poison—”</p>

<p>“Brother!” ejaculated Mistress Rockhurst, huffed
and startled.</p>

<p>But Rockhurst proceeded, his eyes fixed more as if
talking to himself than to her:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, shame grows dearer than merit—vice
becomes as a cloak, warm and soft, in which a man
takes comfort. At the mere thought of cold virtue,
of stern duty, of naked purity, ugh! we shiver and
hug ourselves—”</p>

<p>His sister gave a faint, shocked cry, and flung out
her hand:—</p>

<p>“But not you, not you, my lord! Surely these are
strange words.”</p>

<p>“Harry shall be a man of better stuff,” the father
cried. “He’s wholesome now, body and soul, and
by the Lord, I say, I’ll keep him so! How now,
Alicia, shall I not have pure-blooded, pure-hearted
grandchildren, an I have the mind?”</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the excellent lady took
deep umbrage at this last remark.</p>

<p>“Surely, surely!” she repeated, tossing her head,
so that her grey curls danced.</p>

<p>“So let it be, then,” bade her brother. Then, in
a changed voice he exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Hush, now, here comes the country widow.
Faith, the lad hath taste.”</p>

<p>But here he fell suddenly silent and sprang up.
Mistress Rockhurst, surveying him in some anxiety,
marked the extraordinary change that came over his
countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I am a sinful woman” (she afterward told
her special gossip), “his lordship turned whey-white.
And I do assure you, madam, his eyes blazed in his
head—the like of which I have never seen before.
’Twas almost as if he and she had known each other
and had never dreamed to meet again. And as for
my fine young madam, she came along with her eyes
on the ground—nay, the most bashful thing between
this and York City. But when she looks up and
sees my lord, as white as he went, she goes rosy, and,
please you, gives a kind of cry with both her hands
outstretched. That may have been artfulness.
And if so, my lord met it even as I could have wished;
for he but made her a deep bow, and, says he presently,
in his very grand way, ‘It gives me pleasure,
madam, to make your acquaintance.’ At which
you should have seen how was taken aback the
widow! ‘Make your acquaintance’ (mark me),
says he, which shows he could not have known her
before, after all.”</p>

<p>Harry, who had brought his lady in such pride
beneath his father’s glance, stood somewhat dashed
in the silence that followed Lord Rockhurst’s ceremonious
greeting. By nature the most unsuspicious
of youths, in his simple existence he had
never felt the necessity of studying inner motives in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
those around him. He knew the tricks of bird and
beast, but the secrets of his fellow-creatures he
guessed not at. And so all the tokens that his
aunt’s shrewd eye had noted were lost upon him.
His father had been a trifle over-ceremonious toward
a fair neighbour, let alone the mistress of his
son’s heart. And she, his dear love, had blushed
and grown pale, as was but natural.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he cried at last, anxiously, “now that
you have seen Mistress Harcourt, do you not give
me some reason?”</p>

<p>His father turned a singular glance upon him.</p>

<p>“Reason enough, lad,” he said, under his breath,
“reason enough for any folly!”</p>

<p>Diana’s clear cheek had now resumed its usual
pretty tint; but as her young lover spoke, it deepened;
and at Rockhurst’s words, faded again slightly.</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord,” said she, speaking for the first
time—her voice was low and troubled—“I know
not what Master Harry hath been saying of me. It
is his kindness that he will think so well of me,
and—nay, I must say it, Harry—’tis his foolishness
that he will not understand that he is over-kind.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst took Diana’s hand from his son’s
hold, where it still rested unconsciously. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
thoughts were in his mind, as strangely conflicting
as the forces in his nature. His keen knowledge
of women and their ways told him that no woman
who loved a man would have let her fingers lie so
listlessly in his grasp. “My poor lad—she has
no heart for him,” cried the father in him. But the
man in him, as yet unsubdued by years or sorrow,
rejoiced. Here was one who, nameless to him, had
yet shone like a star in his troubled sky this many a
month, for the sake of one hour, snatched, sweet,
pure, sacred, out of an unworthily spent life. With
all that was best in him, he had wished to keep her
unknown, unattainable; and here she was, brought
back by fate into his path!</p>

<p>No one could have guessed at the storm seething
within him after his moment of self-betrayal. His
usual polished composure governed face, voice, and
gesture.</p>

<p>“My son has told me much about you, madam,
truly,” he was saying; “and yet I see how little he
has been able to tell me.”</p>

<p>’Twas the merest idle compliment. The words
were as artificial as the tone. Diana courtesied in
silence. Not thus did she remember her grave,
chivalrous protector in an hour of doubt and peril.
Nay, then, that memory had best be effaced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
her mind, since it was his pleasure to deny it. Perchance
(and the thought was more galling to her
pride!) though she had so fondly kept his image
in the deep recesses of her soul, hers had already
faded from his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lord,” she began, rallying her spirits,
“I too—” but she paused, for her brother and Lionel
Ratcliffe were approaching, the latter with his cool
air of indifference, the other all agape with
curiosity.</p>

<p>Harry instantly took the younger man by the arm
to present him to his father.</p>

<p>“One moment,” rebuked Rockhurst; “the lady
is speaking. Pray, madam?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord,” said she, with formal grace,
“the poor sentence was, certes, never worth such
courteous attention. I was but about to say that I,
too, have heard of your lordship often.”</p>

<p>“Aye? From what source?” he asked, and a
shadow fell on his face.</p>

<p>But she was smiling.</p>

<p>“From this source,” she answered him, waving
her roses toward Harry.</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried Rockhurst, laughing upon a sigh,
“no doubt the rogue has full wearied you with the
subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas,” she responded quickly, “must I not take
this reproach to myself?”</p>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe pulled young Rockhurst by the
sleeve.</p>

<p>“What, all agaze and bewildered, Harry? Never
fear, these are but Court wits in a friendly bout.
Clink, clink, the sparks fly. But, hark to you,
beware an unfoiled weapon.”</p>

<p>The boy withdrew from his touch with disfavour,
and Rockhurst turned upon the whisperer a haughty
look of enquiry.</p>

<p>“Well met again, my lord,” cried Ratcliffe,
swaggering a step forward and saluting with a cavalier
sweep of his hat.</p>

<p>Rockhurst returned the courtesy with a ceremonious
inclination.</p>

<p>“Have we met before, sir?” he enquired.</p>

<p>No whit abashed, Ratcliffe replaced his felt with
the very latest twist of the wrist.</p>

<p>“Does your lordship make it a practice, then, of
not taking your memory out of town? To be sure,
memory is a mighty inconvenient chattel at times.
Natheless, ’tis a fact your lordship and my humble
self have met at the same board. Did I not share
with your lordship, last winter, the privilege of being
the guest of the pretty Mantes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Enough—I remember you, sir,” said his lordship.</p>

<p>“Egad,” laughed Ratcliffe, with elaborate geniality,
“I, sure, did take special note of your lordship,
that night, seeing you with the nymph, our hostess,
whom, I mind me, you had but just whisked from
under the very nose of Jove. Nay, not the first
time (if report spoke truly) that Old Rowley has been
cut out by the Rake—”</p>

<p>The words were arrested on his lips by a look as
sharp as a sword:—</p>

<p>“You have too long a memory, sir. Shorten it.—My
son,” added the speaker, turning his shoulder
upon Ratcliffe, “you were about to introduce the
young gentleman to me.”</p>

<p>“My brother, Sir Edward Hare, my lord,” said
Diana, forestalling her lover.</p>

<p>The interlude with Ratcliffe had perturbed the
group; and with gracious instinct she sought to
cover her cousin’s insolence and young Rockhurst’s
rising anger at insinuations incomprehensible to
country dwellers, yet the hostile intent of which
was but too transparent. Sir Edward, however,
was far from assisting her purpose.</p>

<p>“Nay, brother, brother,” she whispered, as the
bumpkin nodded sulkily. “Doff thy hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell thee, Di,” murmured the injured youth,
“’tis he owes me two bows and a scrape. Ecod:
‘the lady’s speaking,’ quotha! And I with my best
leg already drawn out for him!”</p>

<p>“Your lordship must excuse our rustic manners,”
said Diana, with a pretty glance, half humorous,
half pleading.</p>

<p>Rockhurst looked at her a second musingly.—Yes,
grace, youth, sweetness, all were hers! And
fate had so worked that it was she who was to embody
his son’s young love dream! Dear lad …
small blame to him! He gave an unconscious sigh.
To his countenance came back that air of kindness
which Harry had missed in it so singularly since the
meeting with Diana.</p>

<p>“Of your leave, my son,” said he, then, “I will
have a few minutes’ converse with Mistress Harcourt
apart.”</p>

<p>Harry pressed his father’s hand in delighted response.
He leant back against the sunny wall and
watched his mistress go in grace beside the stately
figure of the great Lord Rockhurst. Lionel took
place beside him, and from narrowed lids looked
smilingly at the young man’s happy countenance.</p>

</div>

<p>Mistress Rockhurst, who, solemnly seated at the
end of her bench, had been a silent yet mightily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
observant witness of the whole scene, now, suddenly
struck by the discontented expression of Edward
Hare’s visage, addressed the youth:—</p>

<p>“What ails ye, Sir Edward?”</p>

<p>“I’m sick at stomach,” growled the candid
baronet. “I hate a peacock.”</p>

<p>“Yet peacock is light fare,” said the lady, with a
twinkle in her shrewd blue eye. “Sick at stomach,
say you? There’s nothing better than a cup of
marjoram water.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward flung the suggestion from him:—</p>

<p>“Water? Ugh!”</p>

<p>“When I say water,” amended she, “’tis strong
water, aqua vitæ.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” quoth he, then, “that’s another matter.
I’m not saying but a tass of it would warm the
innards.”</p>

<p>She despised him heartily for a monstrous poor
scion of a noble family; yet the housewife was too
strong in her to resist the pleasure of ministering
out of her store, even to an unworthy guest. She
rose, chuckling, jingling her keys:—</p>

<p>“Oh, surely, surely,” she exclaimed, “this small
comfort shall not be denied you here, Sir Edward.
Come but with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PEACOCK_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NEW FRENCH PASS</span></h3>

<p>Rockhurst and Diana, at the extreme end of the
terrace, stood alone in the sunshine, with the June
roses about them.—How much more apart now than
on that night in the snow between the black fir trees
and the waste heath! She flung a sudden, eager
look at him; but before the smooth courtesy with
which he turned to her, drew back into herself,
once more checked and puzzled. It was to be as if
they had only met in a dream? So be it! Then
the thought that he must now regard her as his
son’s choice broke upon her in a flash of revelation—and
anger. Why had she dallied with such folly?
With an involuntary movement she loosened her
grasp on Harry’s roses and they fell round her feet.</p>

<p>“Why, madam,” said Rockhurst, with a forced
smile and a perfunctory solicitude, “your posy,
madam, all in the dust! Nay, permit me to cull
another for you.”</p>

<p>The man of the world had superseded all else. To
place his years in rivalry with his son’s youth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
King’s Lord Constable against the country lad?
Preposterous!</p>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe stood attentively watching his
kinswoman from afar. Beside him, Harry sat,
dreaming, his young eyes fixed on God knows
what golden vision. All at once the elder man
tapped his companion stealthily on the arm.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Harry, starting from his
muse and glancing round none too pleasantly.
“What is it now?” quoth he, frowning.</p>

<p>“Look, look yonder, Master Rockhurst. Your
roses.”</p>

<p>Harry’s glance followed the direction of the
pointing finger. He saw Diana stand, a radiant
vision in the amber light, with empty hands outstretched
toward the flower that Rockhurst was in
the act of gathering, a deep crimson rose that glowed
like a ruby in the sun-rays. And about her feet the
pale, sweet blossoms chosen for her with such love,
but an hour ago! The red rose was carried to Diana’s
cheek; and then she fastened it in her bosom. His
flowers had not been so honoured. He could not
think or reason; he could only look and suffer.</p>

<p>Again Lionel tapped him on the shoulder. He was
smiling. Harry came back to his senses at sight of
that odious smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, and what of it?” he cried, measuring
Ratcliffe with a defiant look.</p>

<p>“What of it? More than you think.—What were
you about, young man,” his voice sunk to a whisper,
“when you invited Rakehell Rockhurst to come and
view your lady?”</p>

<p>“Rakehell Rockhurst…!” echoed Harry in
utter amazement. Then, fury leaping to his voice
and eye, he wheeled fiercely upon Ratcliffe: “Of
whom, sir, are you speaking?”</p>

<p>The latter proceeded, unmoved save for a trifle
more of emphasis in his silky tone:—</p>

<p>“Did you not know that a single breath of his
lips is enough to tarnish the virtue of the purest
woman in England?”</p>

<p>The younger man fell back a step, and measured
the speaker:—</p>

<p>“Of whom are you talking, I have asked you.”</p>

<p>There was more self-control in his demeanour,
but more danger. It was tense with menace, like
a bent bow. A second Ratcliffe paused. He had
not given the lad credit for so much real manliness.
The more reason for him to precipitate the crisis
for which he was working; the crisis which might
rid him of two rivals at once—for the courtly
Rockhurst was indeed a rival to be reckoned with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
And there was no affectation in the passion with
which he now broke out:—</p>

<p>“Of whom, good lad? Of whom?——”</p>

<p class="tb">(Edward Hare, strolling out of the dim coolness
of the buttery into the sunshine again, heard the
sound of loud voices rising from the terrace below.
Grinning, he advanced on tiptoe and bent over the
parapet to listen. Cousin Ratcliffe and young
Harry were at it at last! Even to his dull wits it
had been evident that the quarrel that had long
been smouldering between them was bound to break
into open flame. Better than a wench or a bottle,
better even than cockpit or bear-bait, Sir Edward
loved the sight of a fight between his fellow-men.
He chuckled as he hearkened.)</p>

<p class="tb">“Of whom, good lad, of whom—but the most
noble Viscount, in town the incomparable libertine,
his Majesty’s merry friend, known by Whitehall as
Rakehell Rockhurst—in the country, thy sainted
father! Aye, but, town or country, let Rockhurst
get to windward of a pretty woman, and the devil
will soon show his—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry had stood a moment petrified, but before the
last words were out he had struck Lionel on the
lips:—</p>

<p>“Liar!”</p>

<p>Lionel staggered back; a narrow streak of blood
was running down his chin. In a second he had
whipped out the light riding sword that hung by his
hip, and without a word made a deadly rush. Harry,
however, strong country lad, trained by all the sudden
accidents of sport and chase, had his wits about him.
He stepped aside from the onslaught, caught up
the cloak which lay on the balustrade, and flung
it across the blade.</p>

<p>“Now, if you please,” said he, shaking his father’s
sword free of the scabbard, whilst Ratcliffe, almost
foaming at the mouth, struggled with the encumbering
folds as if it had been his enemy himself, “let
us continue the argument.”</p>

<p class="tb">It was a prettier fight than ever it had been Edward
Hare’s luck to behold at feast or fair. In an
ecstasy he hung over the parapet, jumping from one
foot to the other.</p>

<p>“Sh! Sh!” he shouted, “at it, good dogs!
Ecod, I would not have missed this for forty crowns!
Ha, well pushed, cousin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Harry staggered, waved his sword aimlessly,
then dropped it, pivoted on himself, and fell. He
lay, face downward, and after a moment a coil
of blood, like a slender serpent, began to move
sinuously into the grey of the gravel.</p>

<p>The peacock, from his perch, peered down on the
scene with stupid eyes, cocking its tufted head
inanely from side to side.</p>

<p>The approving smile was petrified on Edward
Hare’s face. He clapped his hand over his mouth
like a frightened child.</p>

<p>“Dead, ecod!” he whispered to himself. Then,
hanging further over the wall, he hailed Ratcliffe
in a quavering shout:—</p>

<p>“Hist, coz—hast never killed him?”</p>

<p>The victor, leaning on his weapon, gazing in
sombre abstraction at the prostrate form, started
and looked up. He smiled hideously with his
swollen lip.</p>

<p>“Be it mortal?” mouthed Edward again.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe answered stonily:—</p>

<p>“Mortal? I trust so. The affront was mortal.”</p>

<p>Then he slowly wiped his blade upon the cloak,
sheathed it with care, and walked steadily away,
along the path that led to the valley.</p>

<p>Hare watched him go, till the dark laurel bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
received and hid him. Then he looked over again
at the motionless figure, and in a panic, sent loud
calls ringing into the air: “Help here! Hoy—Hello!
Master Rockhurst hurt, ill,—dead! Help!”</p>

<p class="tb">Rockhurst was the first to hear the cry. In a
trice he was back in the Peacock Walk, kneeling by
the bench. Hare was at his heels, gabbling his tale.
Half his words went unheeded, but some found
their mark in the father’s heart:—</p>

<p>“And Lionel says: ‘Rakehell Rockhurst’ (he,
he!). ‘A devil with the women!’ says he. And
Harry hits him across the mouth. ‘Liar!’ says
Harry. Oh, ’twas a pretty quarrel. ’Twas a
cracking slap!—”</p>

<p>As Rockhurst lifted his boy and supported him in
his arms, light came back to the eyes so dark in the
white face, and, stretching himself, Harry returned
to consciousness and smiled up at his father like a
waking child. Rockhurst tore the stained clothing
apart with fierce hands, then drew a deep sigh of
relief. His experience in such matters took stock
of the wound—an ugly tear in truth, long, laying
bare the ribs, but not deep.</p>

<p>“’Tis not vital—thank God! Go, call for help,
man!” cried he sharply, looking up at the staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Edward. And off trotted the lout. Now came
Diana, hastening, bewildered.</p>

<p>Lovers have quick ears: through the dimness of
his returning consciousness Harry caught the sound
of her steps. He tried to raise himself in his father’s
embrace. There was a sudden shame upon him that
he had done so womanish a thing as to swoon,
this day when, of all days, he had so much reason to
play the man.</p>

<p>“’Tis a mere scratch, my lord,” he murmured.
Then, with an anxious glance on his father’s face,
he added, stammering: “Master Lionel was showing
me a new French pass, and I—I slipped—” He
broke off; never before had he seen tears in his
father’s eyes.</p>

<p>With a flutter like that of a settling bird, Diana
sank on her knees beside them. With a soft cry,
full of ruth, she took her boy lover’s hand. As
he had passed her, running on Lord Rockhurst’s
errand, her brother had bellowed his tidings:—</p>

<p>“A pretty quarrel! About you, sister! Ecod—there
was talk about your virtue—and Master
Harry’s slap, and Coz Lionel out with his tuck—”</p>

<p>As with the sting of arrows the words drove her
forward. Ah, she needed no further telling to conjure
up the scene: her kinsman had spoken lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of her and her young lover had struck back the
insult. Her boy lover! His youth, that had been
his disability in her eyes, now became eloquent to
plead for him. To see him lie there, pale and blood-stained,
a mere lad.—After the way of women, on
the moment her heart melted all to him.</p>

<p>“Harry, Harry! …” she cried, and the words
were tender as a caress.</p>

<p>Harry turned his languid head.</p>

<p>“And now I cannot ride with you to-morrow—not
even did my lord so permit! Father…!”
Faintness was creeping over him again, but he made
an effort. His voice rang out: “Father, will you
escort her? My Diana!”</p>

<p>It was at once a supreme declaration of confidence
and a solemn charge. The father bowed
his head.</p>

<p>“Your Diana, lad, so be it—I accept the trust.”</p>

<p>Over the poor wounded body the eyes of Rakehell
Rockhurst met those of Diana. There was a steady
sweetness of renunciation in his, that she had seen
there once before. Hers were quickly veiled again,
lest they betray the singular, sharp pain that filled
her heart.</p>

<p>At her swiftest gait, important, yet showing no
alarm, Mistress Rockhurst advanced, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
couple of wenches, bearing varied paraphernalia.
She had lived through the wars—it were a parlous
wound indeed she could not cope with. In her
own hands she carried a flask of renowned cordial.
None too soon, it seemed, for the colour on the pretty
boyish head lying between Rockhurst and Diana
was fading fast again.</p>

<h2>THE KING’S CUP</h2>

<h3 id="CUP_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">LITTLE SATAN</span></h3>

<p>A swift thunder-storm had rushed down the
Thames valley, passed over sultry London with
clamour and hail scourge, and was gone—as sudden
and wholesome as a good man’s passion. The
town lay, a little dazed, it seemed, gasping as one
astonished, yet mightily refreshed.</p>

<p>In the gardens of the Temple every leaf dripped
and shone the brighter; the dry earth drank and
sent up a fragrance to mingle with the scent from
the historic rose-bushes of the inner pleasance, the
glory of which now lay scattered, white and red,
on the turf, each petal with the tears in its heart
glinting under that sky of incomparable blue that
reveals itself after the squall.</p>

<p>Down the steep slope from King’s Bench Walk,
mimic mountain torrents rushed in haste, seeking
the river which rolled, heaving still, a troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
yellow, in angry ebb toward the east, where the
clouds still lowered in their flight.</p>

<p>Even in Whitefriars—that strange, knavish
demesne lying at the very gates of the great legal
college; that debatable land of crime, of statutory
or at least traditional immunities—every dark
lane had been swept as with besoms, if not clean, at
least less foul. The stale airs of <em>Alsatia</em> (as the
cant word went to express that sanctuary of tricksters
and cheats and huffing bullies, of skulking
debtors, rejected clergymen, and disbarred lawyers,
of gaudy courtesans in enforced retreat) were driven
forth before the fresh and mighty breath of the gale.
The gutters ran gurgling, overflowing where they
would. Here and there a choked conduit sent mock
waterfalls from overhanging eaves, darting and
splashing even to the opposite walls. All Alsatia,
which had scuttled to its burrows, was beginning
to pop its head out again; but, as the denizens in
the ’Friars have, as a rule, rare change of garment,
few ventured as yet into the slop and drip.</p>

<p>Thus the two youthful gallants who now emerged
from the Half Moon Tavern, in Priory Lane, had the
length of the street to themselves.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Quelle peste—!</i>” said the slighter and darker
of the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Stepping gingerly aside to give wide berth to the
dismal carcase of a cat, he received the spray from
an odorous gutter-spout full in the neck—and
again exclaimed in French against the pestilential
offence of the place.</p>

<p>His companion nipped him by the elbow, as
he himself, less fastidiously, strode over the
carcase.</p>

<p>“Fie, Vidame,” he cried, “’tis well we’re not at
Whitehall! Never forget ’tis a forbidden word,
just now.”</p>

<p>The Vidame Enguerrand de Joncelles tossed his
black curls with a somewhat scornful look at the
speaker.</p>

<p>“In verity, Sir Paul,” he retorted, in his precise,
quaintly emphasized yet fluent English, “I believe
that, eating, drinking or sleeping, Court rules and
Court favour are never out of your head! As for
the—” his long dark eyes glinted mischievously—“as
for the ugly distemper which begins with a letter
P. in both our tongues, what have people of quality
to do with it? Bah! it is to kill the <i lang="fr">canaille</i>—useful,
like rat-bane.”</p>

<p>“Yet … if you will come into Alsatia—” grumbled
Sir Paul Farrant; and just then, a gush
of intolerable stench striking across them from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
open cellar door, he drew his laced kerchief from
his breast and buried nose and mouth in its folds.</p>

<p>The Frenchman went steadily on, scarce a flicker
of disgust on his narrow, pale face.—If high-born
disdain was safe to keep the plague at a distance,
certes the Vidame de Joncelles—King Charles’s
new favourite page at Whitehall—was proof
against it.</p>

<p>There was silence between the comrades, until the
worn, muddy steps of the Temple-Gate brought
them up from the unwholesome precincts of Whitefriars
into the green and airy spaces of the King’s
Bench Walk. There, shaking out his kerchief,
Sir Paul resumed his interrupted complaint:—</p>

<p>“If you will come to Alsatia.…”</p>

<p>“If your misunderstanding townsfolk will drive
the best fence master within your shores to take
sanctuary in yonder pit—for the merest peccadillo—”</p>

<p>“Peccadillo, Vidame!—Why, the man drew on
our host of the Three Tuns in Westminster, and
slit both his ears, for refusing to serve him with a
flagon of claret on trust…!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Perdi</i>, a wretched innkeeper! It was an insolence
that deserved worse—The hog is not dead!—Meanwhile,
instead of suiting my convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and practising my sword-play in Westminster, I
must now come seek him in this pestilent lane!”</p>

<p>“Why, Master Enguerrand,” said Farrant, standing
still on the wet sod to stare, half in amazement,
half in admiration, at the Vidame, “the fellow
owed him a reckoning as long as his sword.”</p>

<p>“And what of it? Is not such a master as Laperrière,
whose lot in life it is to deal with us nobles,
one of those whom gentles daily cross sword with
and condescend to take instruction from, is not such
an one to be privileged? A reckoning, forsooth!
A master of fence, with us in France, Sir Paul, is
held a gentleman. Our King has even ennobled
many. And those others there, the rabble—are
they not made and born for our service? As for the
rest, as for this Plague that is about, speak no more
of it. If you are so frightened of a little smell,
what brings you day by day to the fencing room
with me?—It is your own doing.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Farrant. “But think you,” he went
on in hurt tones, “I would let you alone to such
dangerous grounds as Whitefriars—you a stranger
and my friend, Vidame?”</p>

<p>They were strolling slowly down across the
gardens toward the river stairs. The Vidame, as
if tired by his exertions in the fencer’s room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
let himself drop on a stone bench in the central
alley.</p>

<p>“Let us rest awhile, please you, Sir Paul. As you
see, the tide is still running out. The turn, which is
to take us back to Whitehall, is not due until after
five o’clock. Let us wait here.”</p>

<p>He doffed his plumed beaver and hung it upon
the cane by his side; then turned his pale, dissipated
face, with a smile of cynical amusement,
toward his companion. Sir Paul Farrant was only
one of the many friends who had gathered so assiduously
about the young Frenchman—a page in
the train of Madame Henriette, sister of the King—since
his Majesty had taken so strong and sudden
a fancy to him as to retain him in his personal service
after her departure for France.</p>

<p>“See how the world wags,” resumed the favourite
then; “you, Sir Paul, seek the dens yonder,”—he
pointed to the sinister purlieus they had just left
behind,—“because of a friend—I, because of an
enemy.”</p>

<p>Farrant pricked his ears under his silken, fair
curls. It was the first time he had been admitted
even so far into the Vidame’s confidence. This
Enguerrand, a French boy who in a few months’
time had stepped, it seemed, without the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
effort into the inner circle of Court favour, upon the
outer rim of which the indefatigable Sir Paul had
scarce a footing, was an enigma to his associates.
He had a handsome sister; but his success depended
not on her, for had she not denied the King for
the sake of the King’s friend, Lord Rockhurst? It
was an open secret in Whitehall. Enough to have
damned the chances of any other man, it would
seem! Yet here was the lad, with his white, handsome,
secret face; with his silent, insolent, easy
ways; with his deep moods, his sudden rages, as
close to his Majesty, as audacious and as secure of
his position as young Monmouth himself. Farrant
had witnessed his first introduction—he knew that
there was no secret tie, no mystery save in the new
page’s own personality. Sir Paul, the failure,
would have given all he possessed for the talisman.
Yet the talisman was no such occult thing, but an
unfailing talent to amuse that most melancholy man,
whom the world liked to call the Merry Monarch.</p>

<p>“An enemy, say you, my good Enguerrand?”
cried the young baronet, lifting his foolish eyebrows
a trifle higher than nature had set them. He had the
curiosity of trivial natures and was all agog.</p>

<p>“Aye, <i lang="fr">perdi</i>,” responded the other, briefly.</p>

<p>The wind was ruffling his dark head, blowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
heavy curls off the forehead; making patent at once
the extreme youth and the prematurely worn countenance.</p>

<p>“And you are then a-practising against a rencounter.…
O, Master Enguerrand, I pray you
that I be your second!”</p>

<p>“Why, you shall so, then.” The words dropped
from the other’s lips in careless condescension.</p>

<p>Enguerrand’s eyes were lost in space. Across
the river, between the merry, white, flying clouds and
the green fields of Surrey, he saw Heaven knows
what bloody vision of triumph.</p>

<p>“And he—the man, the enemy?” asked Sir Paul,
after a while.</p>

<p>“Him whom I shall kill … with that little
escaping thrust of our Laperrière … yes, it shall
be that … the great man? Yet none so great,
Sir Paul, but that he must himself defend his honour
… and none so old but that he be as much man
as I—even as I am none so young but that I am
as much man as he.…”</p>

<p>At which cryptic utterance he folded his delicate
lips on silence.</p>

<p>Farrant stared. There was one to whom the
words applied; one to whom the brother of Madame
de Mantes, as all Whitehall was aware, might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
owe grudge. But, forsooth, that one was so high
placed, a personage of so much importance, that he
dismissed the idea as preposterous. Farrant indeed
had many a secret grudge himself against this powerful
being, against his haughtiness and the lash of his
cold mockery; but he would as soon have dreamed
of seeking satisfaction from his Majesty’s own person.</p>

<p>Enguerrand had fallen into a deep muse. His
comrade began to find the silence tedious, and took
to counting the passage of the barges through the
opening of the Temple water-gate, chattering in
comment:—</p>

<p>“Yonder went the fat master of the Curriers,
Tyrrell, with his pretty daughter—would I had as
good a chance with her as that stout prentice who sits
behind the good man’s back…! Ah, and yonder
went Master Lionel Ratcliffe—mark how his men
pull as if life and death depended on their oars.
I’ll wager you, he’s bound for Chillingburgh House.…
But, no, the skiff keeps its nose down-stream.…
The tide will soon be on the turn.—Eh, as
I live, here comes a royal barge—mark the swing
of the scarlet oars! Old Rowley himself, perchance—nay,
sink me, it is but the Lord Constable!
Odd! I was thinking of him but a moment awhile
… I.… ’Slife, there’s no mistaking that dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
figure! I vow he casts a shade over the royal scarlet
itself. Merry Rockhurst, quotha! Has any one
ever seen him smile, except in mockery? How
now? Why, the barge heads for the Temple stairs!—What
may the Constable of the Tower be seeking
in the Temple?”</p>

<p>The babble died abruptly on his lips, so singular
a change had he marked coming over his companion’s
face: a spasm of vindictiveness followed
by a slow, evil smile. A chill ran through Farrant’s
frame. He was no coward, but he would have given
much to recall his rash offer of a few minutes ago;
for he had read in the Vidame’s eyes the name of
his enemy.</p>

<p>The barge swung with masterly ease to the landing.
A quick word rang out from the head waterman,
and the glistening oars were tossed in the air.
The red of the men’s jackets, the crimson of the
barge’s drapery, stained to rich depths and unexpected
tints of orange by weather and usage, made a
gay picture amid the sparkle of the water, the dancing
shine and shadow, in which the figure of the Lord
Constable was indeed a note of striking gravity.</p>

<p>The wind-ruffled feathers of the beaver were black,
even as the curls that fell on his shoulders. A black
cloak, silver-trimmed, was cast loosely back as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
stepped from the barge, revealing a body-dress of
so sombre a purple as to seem, if possible, of more
severe a tone than the cloak. The keen, pale
face, with the hawk’s eyes, the silver amid the
raven-black of the cavalier moustache and beard,—which
it was the great Lord Rockhurst’s pleasure to
preserve in spite of the newer, clean-shaven fashion,—all
combined to produce a singularly impressive
personality.</p>

<p>Paul Farrant felt upon himself that sense of obtrusive
inferiority, of almost physical discomfort,
which the presence of the Lord Constable scarcely
ever failed to evoke. His lips formed themselves
for a soundless whisper. He twirled his grey beaver
on the end of his cane; and, upon a second thought,
tossed it to his head as giving him an air of greater
ease and self-possession.</p>

<p>The French boy’s countenance, on the contrary,
seemed now to have become lit by a kind of inner
fire that was almost like inspiration. Sir Paul heard
him speak to himself, in French—a tongue which
he knew but imperfectly:—</p>

<p>“He has come! Why not now … why not
this moment!… <i lang="fr">Pardi</i>, why not, my Lord Rockhurst?”</p>

<p>As he muttered the words the Vidame laid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hat and stick deliberately on the bench and rose.
Farrant, his discomposure increasing well-nigh to
horror, watched him step forward, tossing back
his heavy locks, as raven-black as Rockhurst’s
own; and in the pallid, fine-cut young face he
noted for the first time an odd resemblance to
Rockhurst himself.</p>

<p>In the minutes that next followed, while his
English friend remained sitting as if spellbound,
Enguerrand, the stranger in the land, went through
the crisis of his life.</p>

<p>So swiftly did the scene pass that the men in the
barge below had but the time to push off once more
and swing but a single stroke on the return journey
to the humour of the tide.</p>

<p>Rockhurst, walking sedately up the alley, with a
sweep of his tall cane to every other step, halted as
he saw the young man approach; and into his gaze,
which had been somewhat abstractedly fixed upon
the fair green of the garden, there flashed a strange
look.</p>

<p>Sir Paul Farrant was scarce a man of nice observation,
yet he could have sworn that my lord’s
eyes had for a second held a gleam of indulgence
almost approaching to tenderness, as they had
lighted upon the lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well met, my Lord Viscount!” cried Enguerrand,
in a high, excited voice. “Aye—well met!”</p>

<p>If Lord Rockhurst’s glance had been kindly,
it was swiftly and marvellously altered. Intolerably
mocking now and cold it became, to match the tone
of the response:—</p>

<p>“Well met … Little Satan!”</p>

<p>Enguerrand had been holding his passion upon
a frail leash. With a bound it now leaped. This
man, by whom, at their first meeting in Whitehall,
he had conceived himself, in his hypersensitive
French punctilio of vanity, to have been slighted,
and who had treated him from the height of his
crushing superiority, who had thwarted and humiliated
him, robbed him (as he held) of his sister and
his preferment at one swoop—how dare he now
address him in this tone of contemptuous familiarity?
It was well met at last, indeed! The moment he
had dreamed of, sleeping or waking, these two
months was within his grasp!</p>

<p>“My lord,” he cried still more shrilly, “his
Majesty’s familiar name for me, on any other lips
becomes a liberty, an insolence! An insolence, sir,
a liberty I will not permit!”</p>

<p>To his mortification he found himself trembling
from head to foot. For an appreciable moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Rockhurst ran his glance up and down the slight
figure. Then he made answer; and the indifference,
the placidity, of his manner was inconceivably
galling:—</p>

<p>“True—I should not usurp his Majesty’s great
privileges. But, pray, let me pass, Vidame—I
have business with Master Sergeant Stafford, and
I am already late, I fear, for my tryst.”</p>

<p>“Nay, milord, you shall not pass!—My lord,
this is my tryst. It has been your pleasure to heap
injuries on me, and on more than one score you owe
me redress. We meet, at last, oh, at last! upon
ground where the royal ordinance no longer stands
between us. My Lord Viscount Rockhurst—”
He was feverishly stripping his glove from his left
hand as he spoke; but the Lord Constable, with a
single gesture, swept him and his argument from
the path with no more emotion than that of a man
who rids himself of an importunate fly. With the
same measured step he then resumed his course up
the garden alley.</p>

<p>For a second the Vidame stood, staring after him,
paralysed with rage. A faint snigger—of mingled
relief and amusement—from the watcher on the
bench started him to fresh action, as the prick of the
spur starts the mettled horse. In a couple of leaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he had overtaken the stately figure, and Sir Paul
Farrant wheeled round to gaze after the pair,
astonishment as much as prudence keeping him
rooted to his place. Enguerrand dashed the
glove at Lord Rockhurst’s feet. The first impulse
had aimed it at the face; but something stronger
than himself, which the while only increased his
fury, prevented the youth from offering this supreme
insult to one whom years and honours and
personal dignity placed apart even in the King’s
presence.</p>

<p>“My lord, you—because I am a stranger, because
I am, forsooth, young enough to be your son
(<i lang="fr">à Dieu ne plaise!</i>), you imagine you can treat me
at your will and pleasure; insult me at your
mood.… I stand, however, a man before you, my
Lord Constable—with a name as good as yours.
I demand my satisfaction.… My lord, I charge
you, defend yourself!”</p>

<p>The young heart beat so fast, rose so high in his
throat, that the words pulsed from his lips in jerks,
broken with quick breaths. He drew his rapier with
an almost frenzied gesture as he spoke; dashing
baldrick and scabbard on one side; falling back to
swing the blade with dire menace and then springing
forward again, high-poised, tiptoe, only the elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
rules of honour keeping him from assault until
his enemy should have likewise unsheathed.</p>

<p>A second or two, marked by the lad’s panting,
Lord Rockhurst fixed him through half-closed eyelids.
Then, without a word, with a dexterous,
irresistible, upstroke of his cane, he knocked the
weapon from the fierce hand. The springy steel
fell and bounded like a live thing on the flagged
path, to drop again, quivering, close to Rockhurst,
who, with a lightning swiftness unexpected from one
of such majestic bearing, instantly clapped his foot
upon it.</p>

<p>Then the whole precincts of the garden, it seemed,
were filled with the thunder of his voice:—</p>

<p>“Malapert…!” The Lord Constable’s brows
were now drawn over his keen eyes in a withering
frown. “This cane of mine should teach your
youthship better manners were it not for this same
strangerhood of yours, on which you thus presume!
Aye, and you should have remembered this day,
even with stripes, but that some freak of your
Maker’s hath given you, graceless lad as you are,
Vidame, a singular look of my own gracious son.
For his so sweet sake … thou varlet … I
spare thee. Yet will this hour have taught thee
that his Majesty’s officers are not to be molested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with impunity—that the Page of the Wine Flagon
can have no satisfaction to demand of the King’s
Lord Constable, what though his petty vanity may
be a-smarting from some imagined slights.—Slights,
quotha! Young master,—there can be no
slights from me to you…! And for this insolence
of yours to me, take you home this memento.”</p>

<p>With another of his startlingly sudden movements,
Rockhurst stooped for the hilt of the sword that lay
bent under his foot; and snapped the blade in twain,
with as much ease as one may snap a twig. Tossing
the hilt back at the Vidame’s feet, he went on—and
it seemed that his anger had but gathered in
intensity with the action:—</p>

<p>“Hang yonder stump of steel in your bedchamber:
it may serve to remind you of a fruitful lesson learned
in the Temple Gardens—how the satisfaction fit
for a pert page’s receiving is a sound whipping, and
how you, of my mercy, escaped receiving it!”</p>

<p>He stepped from the broken blade, passed the
boy’s rigid figure so closely and indifferently as to
brush him with his cloak, and set his deliberate
way again toward the Temple Hall.</p>

<p class="tb">The Vidame stood stricken with impotent passion,
sick well-nigh to swooning with the violence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
fury in conflict with his complete helplessness;
white as wax, his boyish face distorted, his eyes
blood-injected, swimming in tears; a white foam
at the corners of his mouth, his lips drawn back in
voiceless execration. The nails of his clenched hands
drove themselves into the flesh. It was not until
Paul Farrant rose and laid his hand on his shoulder
that the palsy was broken.</p>

<p>The Vidame shook the touch furiously from him.
His bloodshot eyes rolled from the broken weapon
on the path to the other’s face, on which a malicious
pleasure in his successful friend’s mortification was
but ill concealed by a scarcely more tolerable air of
sympathy. Had it not been for the mutilation of his
weapon, Paul Farrant’s life’s blood might well have
assuaged the Frenchman’s ecstasy of hatred at that
moment.</p>

<p>Then the floodgates were loosed. Foaming, the
tide of passion leaped from Enguerrand’s mouth with
an eloquence that betrayed his race. Usually silent,
the Vidame de Joncelles, encompassed with an
almost northern reserve, yet was through his mother
a child of the south; and at this hour all the exuberance
of the warm land, all the acrid passion that
only its children can feel and which, felt, must
find word expression, broke from him in torrents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of imprecations and curses, half French, half
English:—</p>

<p>“Go thy way, then, my merry Rockhurst—go,
Rakehell Rockhurst! Ha, Rakehell thou mayst
be, but forget not then that I am Little Satan, and
you but the servant of my Great Father!… Go
thy way, sanctimonious hypocrite, you of the grave
face and grey-sprinkled hair, hoary in corruption!
You, put me out of your path…! My hour will
come, my hour will come, my hour will come!
Faugh! I spit at thee; my clean blade was too
fair for thee, thou coward, thou bully, hiding behind
thy state and thy years…! And that prate of
paternity! I, like thy son?… Had I within
my veins a drop of thy coward, hateful blood, I’d
drain them and die laughing that I was rid of thee!
Look at the great man…! Look! Watch
the reverend seigneur! See how yonder wretches
make way for my Lord Constable!—My Lord
Coward!… Look you, Sir Paul, is it not an
admirable spectacle? The King’s friend, the mighty
in council, the example to the Court! Hi, my Lord
Rockhurst—Hi, thou pattern of nobility—what
of my sister, what of Jeanne de Mantes?… And
afraid to fight the brother! Look, look, friends!
Ha, he’s old enough to be my father, and my sister—’tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
his boast! I, like his son, forsooth? And
my sister has but a year of life more than mine!
<i lang="fr">O, que l’âge a ses privilèges!</i> Oh, how that paternal
heart beats to high thoughts! Curse thee, burn
thee, drown thee … coward!”</p>

<p>Stragglers in the garden, attracted by the wild
clamours, had now begun to gather. Up the slimy
steps, from the ’Friars, like obscene beasts venturing
furtively from their lairs, the frowzy, arrogant heads
of thieving bullies,—“Knights of the Posts” and
“Copper Captains,”—scenting a profitable quarrel,
began to emerge. And these were shadowed by
dismal shapes of womanhood, such as in those
haunts were never far from the scenes of strife,
like to the hovering carrion bird.</p>

<p>The Vidame, in his paroxysm, cared as little
whether his words were flung to the solitary winds or
to a thousand listeners. As the Lord Constable’s
cloaked figure disappeared altogether from view
under the Hall archway of the Inner Temple, the
boy’s outburst culminated in an almost eastern
flight of malediction:—</p>

<p>“May your shadow bring a blight wherever it
falls…! May your loves, your hopes, your
desires be bitter as ashes…! May your own
flesh and blood turn against you! May you blast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the life of your own son till he wishes he had never
been born! Curse you…! May your own
flesh and blood curse you! May you want and never
get—seek and never find! May your pillow be
haunted and your waking a horror! May your wine-cup
poison you and the pest follow you and break
out under your footsteps! May fire consume your
pride and your hair grow white in misery, in dishonour,
and then may Death be deaf to your call—!”</p>

<p>He fell back against a tree, breath failing on his
lips; flung one arm against the bole and rested his
brow upon it. Then the tears which his fire of rage
had burned from his eyelids threatened to overwhelm
him in the weakness that follows on all such
unnatural paroxysms.</p>

<p>Sir Paul Farrant stood a moment, dubious. He
glanced from the figure against the lime tree to the
dingy rabble that were drawing ever closer in grinning
curiosity and unholy expectation.—In sooth
(was the thought gathering strength in his mind)
the little new star of Court favour seemed like to be
quenched! Yonder was the lucky youth (to dare
to beard the Lord Constable.… It had been
safer, almost, to have affronted the King!) broken by
a mere twist of that strong hand!</p>

<p>A couple of Templars, grave-looking young men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had halted a few paces away; and now, with a low-voiced
murmur to one another and an angry glance
of scorn flung at the gentry that the clamour had
gathered from below the steps into their trim gardens,
they passed on their way.</p>

<p>Farrant was quick to read the omen. Henceforth,
it seemed, Enguerrand de Joncelles, the King’s
favourite, would have to seek associates in such
doubtful and dangerous company rather than
among gentlemen of standing who had a care for
their reputation and advancement.—The sprightly
Vidame … threatened with a whipping—aha!</p>

<p>So Sir Paul replaced his beaver with a hasty
gesture and, cautiously treading, took path across
the turf toward the water-gate, where he reckoned
to find his skiff in waiting. The while his friend
wept corrosive tears against the bark of the lime
tree.</p>

<p>The “Brothers of the Huff,” the Daughters of
Joy, and other good companions of Alsatia, who had
awaited, expecting sport, glanced at each other in
disappointment. Upon the disappearance of the
Templars, one of their number made a dash for
the silver hilt on the ground; closely hustled by
a second, swift to perceive the intention. This
latter had to be content, however, with the broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
blade, and a scuffle would have ensued had not a
burly personage, who seemed to have authority
among them, put an end to the dispute by possessing
himself of the spoils and hustling the others back to
the stairway.</p>

<p>A girl in tawdry finery now tripped stealthily
toward the young man, who was so completely lost
in the abstraction of his misery to all his surroundings,
that he never felt the nimble touch that drew
from his pocket the laced handkerchief, nor woke to
actuality until her screech of laughter rang into his
ears.</p>

<p>Here another woman sprang from the watchful
group at the head of the stairs and flung herself
between the pilferer and the Vidame, as he stood
staring, white-faced and shaken.</p>

<p>“As for you,” cried she, “march!”</p>

<p>The outflung gesture that accompanied the words
seemed to cow the thieving strumpet.</p>

<p>As the girl slunk away, cursing “French Joan and
her tantrums,” yet in evident awe of her, the newcomer
put forth her hand and touched the Vidame’s
wrist.</p>

<p>Looking at her, dazed, he recognised Laperrière’s
black-browed sister: a strange, sinister figure of
uncertain age, and with sullen remains of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
must have been great beauty, who was wont to sit
moodily stitching in the little antechamber to the
fencing master’s room. She had never a word for
him as he passed daily to and fro, but a long, deep
look: the same look was now plunging into his eyes.
Having gained his attention, she dropped her hand
from his and, folding her arms with a gesture of
some dignity, began, in French, low-voiced and
rapid:—</p>

<p>“Hate! Hatred! Oh, <i lang="fr">la haine</i>…! I have
known it, my young lord! But nothing my brother
can teach or do will help you here! What use is the
sword and the skill of it against him who will not
fight?”</p>

<p>Enguerrand stared at her. Then into his fixed
glance of despair sprang a sudden kindling flash,
in response to the strong, devouring gaze that still
held his.</p>

<p>“You cursed too loud, <i lang="fr">mon joli seigneur</i>. Oh,
too loud…! When one wants revenge, one must
be silent!”</p>

<p>“Revenge…!” echoed Enguerrand, with such
a cry as a despairing lover might give as he echoed
his mistress’s call.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said she whom Alsatia called French
Joan, two brown fingers on her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>She bent forward, lowering her voice still more,
although the mocking rabble that pressed about
them, only kept at bay by her hard and watchful
eyes, could have made nothing of her foreign
speech:—</p>

<p>“Yet you spoke well,” she went on. “‘May the
wine-cup poison you!—May the pest follow you
and break out under your footsteps…!’ A man
may find that in his cup which will give him quick
passage … as quick and quicker than the
pest, believe me. He might have drunk, and the
wine have lain as pleasant on his tongue as
ever; and, lo!—before he can call for his second
draught the pest, it seems, has stilled his heart—or
so will every one say in these days: swooning,
mortal sweat and burning fire, death, all within
the hour.… The pest, indeed, all who had
seen it would swear. Not a sign lacking: except
that it strikes so quick, so quick—no time for
remedies! And yet ’tis not the pest. It holds
within a small thimble. <i lang="fr">He, mon joli seigneur.</i>
A treasure for those who understand hate. My
brother brought back his best sword-passes from
Italy—I brought back better … the <i lang="it">acquetta</i>
… eh, my pretty lord? The <i lang="it">Tofana</i> drops, for
them you hate…! You may trust me …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
they have been tried: else, maybe, we should not be
here … and your luck would thereby be the less.
If fate gave you the chance of mixing such a cup for
the one you curse, what would you give to fate?”</p>

<p>“All I possess,” whispered the Vidame, hotly.
“Anything she asked!”</p>

<p>Again the deep, inscrutable eyes brooded upon him.
Then French Joan showed her white teeth in a smile
that gave a kind of lurid beauty to her dark face.</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see,” she said; “maybe I shall ask
much, maybe I shall ask little.… Give me your
hand, my pretty gentleman,” she cried, raising her
voice into sonorousness again, and speaking in
broken English: “I will lead you back to my
brother’s. I have a cordial for such weakness.—Lean
on me!”</p>

<p>Jeers and shouts responded from the greasy
steps.</p>

<p>“Lean on French Joan, Master Frenchman!
French Joan has a cordial for weak gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“Marry!” cried the girl who had stolen the kerchief,
“will he come out alive again, think ye,
masters?”</p>

<p>“Rather him than me, with French Joan!”
roared the youngest ruffler, clapping his arms around
her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CUP_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE VENETIAN GLASS</span></h3>

<p>“Little Satan,” said Charles, “a plague on all
women, I say!”</p>

<p>The King’s page started from the gloomy muse in
which he had been gazing out of the window recess
of the royal room in Whitehall, at the flowing tide
below.</p>

<p>“Amen—your Majesty!” he answered, with an
attempt at sprightliness, the impotence of which
brought a frown to the discontented face turned
upon him. “As the times go, your Majesty’s wish
carries the charm of possibility.… If all one
hears be true, the plague hath taken already not a
few—”</p>

<p>“Little Satan,” said the King, “many sins can
be pardoned to your infernal reputation; but there is
one, Odd’s fish! unforgivable.… You are growing
monstrous dull, you are tedious. You lack tact,
too, by the Lord! Fie, is it page’s business to put his
master in mind of what he had better forget?—The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
veriest young cit would know better than to prate
in our ears of what they would fain be deaf to.…
Gadzooks, little boy, did we pick you out, think you,
French and pert and joyous, for our Page of the
Bottle, that you might ape our long-faced puritan
ways and go mooning about our person, clapping
your hand to your heart, sighing like furnace or
lover?”</p>

<p>Here a chuckle shook the long, lazy figure sunk in
the Flemish chair.</p>

<p>“Is it love? Marry, it can be but love! Little
Satan in love!” cried the King, avid, in the deep
weariness of his existence, for the slightest pretence
of amusement. “Come, confess—Dan Cupid has
shot his arrow into that sulphureous young heart of
thine! My little devil’s in love—and being in love,
has been as dull company, these three weeks, as any
angel that ever flapped wings.”</p>

<p>The Vidame had left the window recess and now
stood before the King. His hand had indeed gone
to his heart, with what seemed an habitual gesture.
He dropped it by his side and hung his head; a
dull colour crept into his cheeks and faded again.
Never burdened with any superfluity of flesh, he
yet had grown noticeably thin these three weeks,
and the healthy pallor of his face had been replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
by feverish tints as of one wasted by haunting,
unsatisfied fires.</p>

<p>His royal master surveyed him, half irritably, half
concernedly:—</p>

<p>“Come, little Enguerrand—the name of the
cruel, the obdurate one?”</p>

<p>The page again arrested with a jerk the involuntary
motion of his hand to his breast, flung back his head
and suddenly laughed.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, she is beautiful, if dark; and I
believe that I shall kiss her on the lips before long.”</p>

<p>But Charles, though the most easy-going of monarchs,
could rebuke undue liberty by a mere upraising
of one heavy eyebrow. This sign of displeasure
and the silence with which he received his
page’s seemingly pert answer brought the blood
leaping again into Enguerrand’s wasted cheek. If
he could hate, this passionate youth, he could also
love; and he loved Charles with an intensity only
second to his hatred for the Lord Constable. He
shook his curls over his face to hide his confusion.</p>

<p>Charles yawned and sank a fraction lower in his
great chair. For a man who demanded but one
thing of life,—that it should run even,—fate was
playing him sorry tricks these days. Sickness and
discontent were growing apace in the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
money difficulties were pressing increasingly upon
him, the progress of the war was doubtful, the
quarrels of the Stewart and the Castlemaine made
Whitehall a place of vast discomfort; and, besides,
there were the interlacing circles of intrigue spun
about him by consort, children, brother, ministers,
divines, ruined loyalists, aspiring mistresses.</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish! Little Satan,” he resumed, good-humoured
even in his exacerbation, “can you not
consult your Great Father and find me an hour’s
diversion?”</p>

<p>“Will your Majesty be pleased to survey the present
of Venetian glass sent by his Majesty of France?—The
chandelier has been suspended from the
ceiling of the small supper room, the great mirror
hung upon the wall, and the drinking vessels laid
out on the buffet—according to your Majesty’s
order. I saw it done this morning.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said the King.</p>

<p>When these instructions had been given, he had
planned a discreet party in the newly adorned
chamber. But, two had heard of an invitation that
one only had received. And the royal temper was
still smarting from the consequent recriminations.
He thought back on the distasteful scene, now, with
renewed injury:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gad, I’ll banish the petticoats … though,
by the Mass, the periwigs are little better! I
shall have Buckingham drawing on Hamilton
for the privilege of annexing my Venetian glass!”
He chuckled bitterly at the sense of his own too
easy good nature. “I trust they’ve nailed the
mirror fast,” he cried aloud; “I am told it is
mighty fine.”</p>

<p class="tb">Yet there was one of his chosen companions who
had never sought for either advancement or booty,
and who had a humour that fitted well with his own
in these moods of reaction, when the voluptuary
yielded to cynical melancholy.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Charles, suddenly lifting himself
in his seat with an animation he had not hitherto
shown, “it is a week or more since I have seen my
‘Merry Rockhurst.’ Get you to the Tower, Little
Satan, as fast as your black wings can carry you.
Bid my Lord Constable to the rescue. Tell him I
am dull, <i lang="fr">que je m’ennuie, Vidame, et qu’il vienne
s’ennuyer avec moi</i>, for I am persuaded he is as dull
as I am. ’Tis the fate of good wit in a weary world.
How now—not gone?”</p>

<p>“Sire,” said the lad, in a toneless voice, “Lord
Rockhurst is at Whitehall. I saw him at his writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
but just now, as I passed the Window of his apartment.”</p>

<p>“All the better fortune! Haste, then,” said the
King. “But hark ye, Little Satan: Rockhurst
alone! God forbid there should be a flounce near
our presence to-night! Bid the Lord Constable
come and crack a bottle with us as in the old days
of Flanders.”</p>

<p>A rueful grin spread over his saturnine countenance.
Castlemaine and Stewart had been overmuch
for him this morning in their division: united,
against a new rival—no, the thought was beyond
the pale of contemplation!</p>

<p>Once outside, in the great corridor, filled already
with evening gloom, Enguerrand paused:—</p>

<p>“Bid the Lord Constable come and crack a bottle
with us…!” The boy flung back his head and
breathed sharply, through dilated nostrils, as if
scenting ecstasy. His moment,—so long brooded
upon, desired with such acrid ardour,—was it at
last within his grasp? His hand went up to his
breast with that gesture that had attracted the King’s
notice. Aye, there it lay over his heart, the tiny
phial of French Joan! Day and night he felt it,
burning, biting into his soul; day and night he heard
it whispering, urging, at once tormenting and delighting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Since that horrible hour in the Temple Gardens,
it was all he had left to look for in the world. His
life, shamed in his own eyes, was a worthless thing.
That other life once swept away, nothing would
matter that could befall him, be it death or disgrace.
He went to sleep every night holding the phial
against his heart.… His Vengeance, dark and
beautiful…! as the lover holds his lady’s guerdon.
The moment, was it actually drawing at hand
when he was to kiss her on the lips?</p>

<p>He gave a sudden laugh—secret-sounding yet
triumphant, the abandoned laugh of the madman
over his obsession—which startled a sleeping page
at the end of the passage as with a sense of terror
in the air, and he set off running on his errand, past
the astonished servants.</p>

<p class="tb">When he reached the Lord Constable’s Whitehall
apartment, by the Holbein gateway, his lordship
was still sitting at his table in the dusk, apparently
absorbed in some deep revery; so deep indeed that
he stared at Enguerrand with unseeing eyes. The
white-haired servant had twice to repeat the announcement:
“The King’s page, my lord, with a command
from his Majesty,” before his master roused
himself to attention. Then the Lord Constable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
turned his fine head questioningly toward the
messenger.</p>

<p>Enguerrand bowed low, tasting, in a kind of inner
intoxication, the full sense of his own irony:—</p>

<p>“His Majesty bids you to supper, my lord, to
crack—these are his Majesty’s own words—a
bottle of Rhenish, as in the old days of Flanders.
His Majesty is melancholy and—commands that
you come and be melancholy with him.”</p>

<p>The faintest shadow of a smile passed over the
grave, listening countenance. Any one who once
came under the gaze of those brilliant, haunting eyes
of the Lord Constable’s could well conceive that such
an order was of easy obedience. He sat in melancholy,
as his royal master sat in tedium: hence the subtle
pleasantry of ‘my Merry Rockhurst.’</p>

<p>“Thank you, Vidame,” said he, half rising, with
a formal inclination of the head. “Inform his
Majesty, if you please, that I attend instantly.”</p>

<p>The French boy had to pause outside the gateway
door, to battle with the suffocating rage that suddenly
invaded him. Rather would he have received fresh
insults from his enemy than this perfect courtesy—a
courtesy which at once seemed to remember and to
pass over. In that last glance that rested upon him,
in that deep, brooding look, there had almost lurked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
(or so he thought) pity. Pity! Enguerrand tore
open the ruffle at his throat and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>Then, as swiftly as it had come, the paroxysm
passed. Weakling, to waste his energies on fruitless
curses! Was not his hour nigh, and did he not need
the cool head, the steady hand, the quick eye?…
He once had offered his honour and his sword for
a chivalrous test … they both had been broken
and cast from him.… Vastly well! Now would
he pass the secret thrust for which there is no parry!
He fastened his ruffle again with fingers that now
scarcely trembled. And, as he ran back to the royal
apartment, he broke shrilly into a stave of song:
that same <i lang="fr">frondeur</i> lilt that had tickled the royal
ears from Sister Jeanne’s lips on yonder night when
she had met fortune and jilted her—at the King’s
supper party:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i lang="fr">“La Tour, prends garde, la Tour, prends garde,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i lang="fr">De te laisser abattre…!”</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">rose the high notes.</p>

<p>“Master Page,” said a yeoman sternly, “have you
taken leave of your wits? The King is within.…”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said Enguerrand, poising himself
for a moment on one springing foot, and looking
back over his shoulder like some light Mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in satin and ringlet. “I know, good old greybeard,
and ’tis I serve his Majesty’s supper to-night!”</p>

<p>Then, as he leaped forward again, he took up the
song, under his breath, this time, and in English,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Tower, have a care, O Tower, beware!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Halfway down the corridor he paused once more,
and once more looked back:—</p>

<p>“Look out for my Lord Constable of the Tower,
you, Master Beefeater … for he sups with the
King to-night!”</p>

<p>His laugh echoed as he disappeared in the antechamber.</p>

<p>“A murrain on these French crickets to whom his
Majesty is fain to give what should belong to honest
English lads!” grumbled the yeoman, as he ordered
his halbert with a thud. “’Tis mercy we have such
gentlemen as my Lord Constable about the person—to
keep balance. And here indeed comes my noble
lord.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst halted a second beside the old yeoman.
The gnarled hand that grasped the halbert had lost
one finger: Rockhurst knew in what fight. Kings
may forget what leal subjects have suffered for them,
and ladies what lovers have sighed and served,
but the captain forgets not the man who has stood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
his ranks. Rockhurst’s hair was turning grey and
the yeoman’s was white—but they had been young
together in the days of Edge Hill.</p>

<p>“A sultry evening, good Ashby,” said the Lord
Constable, with his kind, sad eyes on the rugged face
that crimsoned with joy under the honour.</p>

<p>“Aye, my lord—aye!” muttered the yeoman in
gruff tones. (For the more your Englishman’s heart
is touched, the gruffer rings his voice.) “There’s
storm brewing, or so my old wounds tell me, my
lord.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,”—Rockhurst took up the sound, as he
walked on,—“the storm keeps brewing, and our old
wounds keep aching.”</p>

<p>The veteran looked after him:—</p>

<p>“God save your honour!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="CUP_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PHIAL OF ACQUETTA</span></h3>

<p>The bunches of wax candles were lit in the parlour
reserved for the King’s intimate gatherings. Across
the outside vision of lowering sky and of black
water, spangled with tossing lights, citron-yellow
curtains were drawn.</p>

<p>The new Venetian chandelier sparkled with delicate
opalescent tints as it hung over the supper table:
there were pink roses and green leaves, amber
flowers and blue, most wondrously wrought in glass
upon its twisted branches. The cluster of goblets
on the buffet, shot with gold, had the glow of
jewels. Two cups stood out from the rest: each had
a fantastic sea-horse with dragon tail for its base,
supporting on its grotesque head—gaping-jawed
with red-curved tongue—a bowl as fine and as
miraculously coloured as a bubble. This delicate,
magic array of colour and sheen was reflected in a
great mirror which filled the panel of the wall behind
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>This last of the Venice gifts was of severer art than
the rest; and where it did not hold the bubble
splendour repeated in its depths, it shone coldly,
crystal and silver, from the dark wainscot.</p>

<p>Charles was momentarily lifted out of his heavy
mood by amusement and curiosity.</p>

<p>“Marry!” he said, “if these be our cousin of
France’s leavings, what must be the treasure he has
kept! Look up, my lord, this mirror—’tis a curious
and pretty piece, and reflects the light a hundred
times more gaily than our silver and bronze. And
the drinking gear yonder…! The Apocalypse
itself in glass!”</p>

<p>He strode to the side-table and laid a finger against
the fair cheek of one of the goblets—then he
glanced up and caught sight of his own dark visage
in the new mirror. The gleam of satisfaction
instantly vanished from the long and melancholy
countenance.</p>

<p>“And gad, my lord,” he cried, “if you think I
shall be left as much as this little tass, within a
week! Oh—there’ll be one whose face will look
vastly better than mine in yonder mirror; and
another whose tiring-room can never be bright again
without such a toy as yon!”</p>

<p>He turned and snapped his fingers impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
toward the soft-footed servants who came and went
between the door and the sideboard with viands and
flasks.</p>

<p>“Away with them, away with them! We’ll sit
together as in old times—eh, my merry Rockhurst?—and
keep but Little Satan there to fill a cup.”</p>

<p>“I oft waited on you, alone, in Holland and elsewhere,
sire,” responded the Lord Constable’s deep
voice.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” said the King, in the same half-testy,
half good-humoured manner. “But we have a
demon handy to-night. Tush, man,” proceeded he,
flinging himself into the leathern chair and shaking
out the Flemish napkin, “things are better with us,
and things are worse with us; let us drink and remember—and
drink and forget! Ha, my lord, we
oft had neither pasty nor capon in those days—but
I’ll say that for thee, Harry, you were master cellarer,
and you never let me lack decent wine—”</p>

<p>“My liege,” said Rockhurst, a note of tenderness
creeping in through his grave tones, “we had to
pledge a great cause, and the wine had to be worthy
of the cup!”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said Charles. “I mind me of a certain
yellow Rhenish: it had a smack—where you got it
I never knew, Harry, but it had a smack!—The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cause, say you? Plague on your hypocritical
gravity…! Tush, man, we drank to black
eyes and blue, to trim ankles and laughing tongues.
Those were the days of that jade Lucy … ha,
the pair of eyes! And what shall we pledge to-night?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, the old days, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Aye—the old days, good days … and all
the better, being past! None can say I am an ambitious
sovereign—eh, my solemn Constable? I ask
no more of my people than that they should never
send me on my travels again.… ’Tis modest,
patriarchal—a home-keeping sovereign! No one
can accuse me of not spending my substance among
my subjects!”</p>

<p>“Indeed and indeed, no, sire!” said Rockhurst,
without the slightest twinkle in his straight look.
“As for spending, my liege, your Majesty has indeed
a royal mastery of the art.”</p>

<p>“Go to!” said the King. “Wet that too dry
humour of thine with a draught.—Nay, Little Satan,
none of your dark-liveried claret to-night; we’ll
have the merry yellow wine in yonder long flagon.
Away with this dull glass, too.—Go, play with the
Apocalypse. Those dragon beakers, I’ll swear
they’ll hold half the flagon apiece.—And you shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
have a brimmer and drink it to the last drop, my
Lord Constable, for if I’m never to have you a merry
dog again, by the Lord, I’ll have you a drunk one!—Vidame,
I say you shall see my reverend Lord
Constable drunk, and have something to laugh at to
your dying day—for ’tis then the solemnest villain
that ever staggered on human legs.”</p>

<p>Enguerrand had been a presence in the room as
noiseless as a spirit. Yet every word that passed
between the two men—the sovereign and his old
comrade—had added intensity to his murderous
passion. The boy loved the King. Unhappy,
abnormal creature! He could neither love nor
hate in reason, was as much racked with jealousy of
his master’s regard as a lover of his mistress’s favour.
Every look of old familiar friendship that Charles
flung at Lord Rockhurst, every easy word, proclaiming
a sympathy and confidence that placed them
almost on brotherly equality, was as a lash on the
raw wound of his pride—a spur to his leaping
hatred.</p>

<p>At the King’s command he filled one of the dragon
beakers from the long-necked bottle with a singular
precision, though his hand was cold as ice, and his
pulse beat to suffocation in his throat. He set the
wonderful glass—more wonderful than ever now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
with the golden liquid shining within its flanks—beside
the King’s plate.</p>

<p>“Odd’s fish—a truly royal cup! As I live, the
fair half of the bottle!… Now, boy, the other
half to my Lord Constable.”</p>

<p class="tb">Over by the sideboard, under the cold gleam of
the mirror, the King’s page paused a second, and
his hand went a last time to his breast. Out, little
phial! It lay in the hollow of his palm, no larger
than a lady’s thimble. Break, silken thread!
His moment had come: the lover would kiss his
dark mistress on the lips! There was buzzing
as of a thousand angry bees in his ears.… He
never noted how still the room had grown. Now
his hand hovered over the rim of the full beaker—a
strange gesture, as of the priest blessing the
cup…!</p>

<p>“Little Satan.…” said the King.</p>

<p>Though neither loud nor sharp, there was something
so singular in Charles’s voice that Rockhurst
started from his wonted abstraction.</p>

<p>As for Enguerrand, he was struck full into his
heart. Involuntarily he straightened his hand and
the empty phial fell lightly on the carpet. He
remained a moment staring into nothingness; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
slowly raised his eyes, and met the King’s eyes in
the Venetian mirror.</p>

<p>Charles’s face in the glass … his glance was
terrible! Terrible, too, was his voice as he spoke
again, though it was lower than usual, and very
distinct, very quiet:—</p>

<p>“Bring me that cup, Little Satan.”</p>

<p>And as the boy mechanically lifted the dragon
goblet and turned round, holding it in both hands,
for it was brimming, Charles leaned across the table
and passed the twin cup, his own, toward Rockhurst,
who sat in wonder.</p>

<p>“The King should have the fuller draught,” he said.
“Why do you wait there, Little Satan?—Bring
me that cup, that I may pledge my noble friend the
Lord Constable.”</p>

<p>With this Enguerrand heard his doom. Had the
King ordered him to torture and death he could not
have punished him so mortally as by this quiet order.</p>

<p>A second more he stood, with fascinated eyes,
staring at his beloved master: there was not the
faintest answer in Charles’s relentless gaze. Then
a dreadful smile broke on the young face. Without
a word Enguerrand de Joncelles lifted the beaker
to his own lips and drank.</p>

<p>It was a long draught, and every gulp was an effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to the constricted throat. Yet there was no interruption;
and for a seemingly endless span of silence
and tension the boy stood and drew the death into
himself—his eyes, over the lovely, fragile rim,
fixed in agony upon the King.</p>

<p>Charles made no sign, but waited.</p>

<p>When the last drop was drained, Enguerrand
unclasped his fingers on either side. The dragon
glass fell and was shivered.</p>

<p>Here Rockhurst leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Good God, your Majesty!” he exclaimed.
“What is this?”</p>

<p>“Sit down again,” said the King, coldly. “The
Vidame de Joncelles has voluntarily assumed to-night
a new service about our person. It is a service
which hath fallen into desuetude at the Court of
England. And the young gentleman has proved a
greedy taster and a clumsy one.—I am still waiting
for my wine.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst’s gaze went in deep uneasiness from
Charles’s face, set in lines of unwonted severity, to
the livid countenance of the boy, who leaned back
against the sideboard, scarce able to support himself.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, sire,” he began, pushing back his
own cup—“the matter can scarce remain.…”</p>

<p>But his sovereign again interrupted him, this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
with the royal peremptoriness which admits of no
discussion:—</p>

<p>“There is but one thing we will not pardon, and
it is that you add to our tedium: we commanded your
presence here to-night that you might share it, not to
increase it. But, meanwhile we are waiting,—Monsieur
de Joncelles,”—and for the first time
he raised his voice sharply,—“we are waiting.”</p>

<p>The boy passed his hand across his forehead and
dashed back the curls that were already growing
damp. That the King should have no pity on him,
and yet spare him thus—it was befitting one whom
he had worshipped from the very first for his true
royalty. A kind of fierce pride awoke in him and
spurred him to meet his death in a manner worthy
of such clement cruelty. Though the lights were
beginning to swim before his eyes and he rather
groped than saw, he contrived to open a second
flask and fill another of the Venetian beakers.</p>

<p>Then—for French Joan had been faithful, and
swift was the working of her gift—he had to make
a heroic effort to bring the glass to the King. But
the very fierceness of the effort, final flare of an
indomitable spirit, carried the failing body through.</p>

<p>Enguerrand came to the table with measured
step, although it seemed to him he trod illimitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
air; went down slowly on one knee and uplifted
his rigid hands, clasping the substance he no longer
felt. The ultimate action of his life was the yielding
of the cup into the King’s hand.</p>

<p>As the King took and drank, the boy fell.</p>

<p>“Why, the lad has swooned…! some aqua
vitæ!” exclaimed Rockhurst.</p>

<p>But Charles flung out his hand with his rare gesture
of command:—</p>

<p>“Nay, my lord.—He is dead, or dying. Little
Satans do not do their work by halves. He is dead
or soon will be.—Odd’s fish!” added the King,
after a moment’s frowning meditation, “when you
lured that linnet, his sister, to sing for you in the
Tower, Harry, you little thought her song was to
have such an echo!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst stared for a moment horror-stricken—his
glance roamed from the broken beaker to the
cups on the table and thence to Enguerrand’s convulsed
face. A glimmering of the truth began to
dawn upon him; the mystery was dissolving before
a tragic and dreadful light. Even in the midst of
the King’s words he dropped on one knee to raise
the prone figure. The livid head fell limply back
over his arm. The King cast one look down and
averted his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Away with him!” he cried, in an explosion
of nervous irritability. “Away with him! Call
whomsoever you want to carry him, do what you
list, get what physician you wish,—the lad’s dead,
and ’tis the end of it! You understand, I’ll not hear
another word about the matter.… Gadzooks!
what a finish to a tedious day! Away with him,
I command you, my Lord Rockhurst!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst, who had half risen at the King’s sharp
tones, now bent once more down and gathered the
inert form into his arms.</p>

<p>“Will your Majesty, then, open the door for me?”
he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>The King sprang up from his chair, dashing his
napkin on one side, and flung open the door with an
angry hand.</p>

<p>The slam of its closing echoed down the great
corridors. So would Charles ever shut the unpleasant
episode out from his life. Yet he had not quite
succeeded: as he went moodily back to the table, his
foot struck against the empty little phial. With
precaution, placing the napkin between it and his
palm, he held it to the light. It was wrought of
Italian glass, with twisted lines of blue and red, not
much larger than a filbert nut.</p>

<p>A vision swam before his eyes: Rockhurst’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
face, upturned as he had but just now seen that of
his French page; and, like it, livid in the hues of
death.</p>

<p>“Little Satan! …” he said aloud.</p>

<p>It was the last time that the words were ever to
cross his lips. He cast the phial out through the
open window and heard the faint splintering crash
echo from the flags below.</p>

<p class="tb">Rockhurst had taken but a few steps down the
passage, when some inexplicable impression bade
him pause and glance down at his sad burden.</p>

<p>The light from one of the wall sconces fell full on
the boy’s face: a subtle change, that was scarcely so
much a quiver as a composing of all the features,
was passing over it, driving away the terrible pinched
look of agony and restoring something of its youthful
beauty. Then Enguerrand opened his eyes and
stared up into the Lord Constable’s countenance.
Rockhurst had never before met those eyes but that
he had found hatred in them. At this supreme
moment there was no hatred, only a kind of desolate
wonder. Then, even as their gaze met, the soul
that seemed to seek his was gone; the eyes wondered
no more.</p>

<p>Rockhurst stood still, an intolerable pain at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
heart. It was almost as if he held his own son’s
dead body on his breast. The ring of the yeoman’s
halbert, the tramp of his heavy foot, roused him from
the revery. He strode forward a few steps more.</p>

<p>“Ho, Ashby,” he called, “I have need of
thee!”</p>

<p>“Nay, in God’s mercy,” cried the old man,
drawing near, “that is never the French lad!”</p>

<p>He laid the halbert against the wall, and hastened
to relieve his captain from the burden. Then, as
he felt one of the small hands, cold and limp:—</p>

<p>“Dead, and dead in very surety! Why, ’tis not
an hour since he passed me, singing like a swallow
on the wing, and hopping for all like a squirrel.”</p>

<p class="tb">Very serious was the face of the King’s physician,
and pale his cheek, as he lifted himself suddenly
from the examination of the corpse that had been
laid on my Lord Constable’s bed, in the room by the
gateway.</p>

<p>He turned hastily and, forgetting all decorum,
pushed not only the yeoman, who was awaiting his
orders, but my lord himself, from the chamber.</p>

<p>“We can do nothing—the boy is dead!”</p>

<p>Then he leaned over and breathed rather than
spoke into Rockhurst’s ear the single word, “Plague.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Adding aloud, the while fumbling in his pocket for
his pomander box:—</p>

<p>“One of those monstrous, sudden cases we are
told of—but which I confess I have never seen!
Merciful heavens … in Whitehall! Your lordship
must submit instantly to fumigation. Aye,
and yonder yeoman, too, who carried the body.”
This between prolonged sniffs at the pierced lid of
his pomander box. “Pray, my lord, inhale of this,
deep—and you, too, fellow, after his lordship!
And the burial must be early in the morn—poor
lad! And, my lord, I beseech let it be in secret.
Oh, we must hold our tongues about this, my Lord
Constable! The sickness in Whitehall, and in his
Majesty’s very apartment!… Not a word to his
Majesty! The lad has died of a fit—a rush to the
head. Tut, tut—the truth must be kept secret
indeed!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst had listened with immovable countenance.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said gravely, “it shall be kept secret.”</p>

<p>And, after inhaling the pomander box with due
solemnity, he handed it to yeoman Ashby. But
as soon as the physician, taking a hurried <i lang="fr">congé</i>,
had left the anteroom, he laid his hand on the old
soldier’s shoulder:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never fear, man, neither you nor I shall catch
the sickness whereof this poor youth died, you can
take your captain’s word for warrant. Nevertheless,
I charge thee, speak no word, but, as the physician
hath it—a rush to the head!”</p>

<p class="tb">Yet rumour ran abroad, as rumour will. And
Sir Paul Farrant, hearing of his whilom friend’s
tragic death, had never a doubt that it was in those
haunts of Alsatia that he had first met the distemper—and
himself started off to the pure airs
of Farrant Chace, where he spent a dismal month
watching for symptoms.</p>

<p>Over the grave, in Tothill Fields, where the
passionate, revengeful heart lay now in quietude,
a stone was erected by the Lord Constable’s order,
which set forth the Vidame de Joncelle’s names and
titles, and recorded he had died in the flower of his
age, honoured by the King’s regard.</p>

<h2>LADY CHILLINGBURGH’S LAST CARD-PARTY</h2>

<h3 id="LADY_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS</span></h3>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe closed behind him the gate of
the house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields where he had his
lodging. He crossed the road, then paused to survey
the desolate scene.</p>

<p>The day was drawing to a close, but sullen fires of
sunset were still burning low under a leaden, cloudy
sky. Beneath his feet the grass was parched, the
ground everywhere leprous grey. Though it was only
early July, the foliage of the trees hung limp and
sick-hued; there was not a flicker of life among the
branches—indeed, hardly a stir anywhere in the languid
atmosphere. Sky seemed to brood over earth,
earth to lie paralysed, awaiting some moment of catastrophe,
and heavy vapours to be fusing them together.
The heat was a palpable presence. An anguished
expectation caught the throat as with an actual pressure.
The plague held all London in its grip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Men can walk with fortitude under the wings of the
Angel of Destruction, when the death he brings is a
clean one, honourable, seemly; but this horrible
Demon of Corruption that now spread its shadow
over the world made its victims loathsome in each
other’s eyes and infected them with coward selfishness
and panic fears.</p>

<p>The Court had gone at last, though Charles was no
poltroon. Half the population was in flight along
country roads; blind terror was upon most of those
whom circumstances retained within the doomed
circle. Among the well-to-do only three classes
still lingered in the town: those whom a sense of
duty kept at their post; those again who, with a
strange but not unknown faculty of self-deception,
chose to ignore the visitation rather than to face the
appalling presence; and lastly, those few strong
natures who, for purposes of their own, found it
worth while to set danger at defiance.</p>

<p>To these last belonged Lionel Ratcliffe. Fully
aware of the peril, he challenged it deliberately.
He knew that those yellow vapours were the very
breath of the pestilence; that the smell everywhere
meeting his nostrils was that of death; that among
yonder prostrate figures reclining beneath the trees
many were doubtless stricken, dying, or dead. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
kept on, nevertheless, calm if wary, at a masterful
gait, across the fields.</p>

<p>In his hand he swung a loaded cane of such proportions
as almost to rival a watchman’s staff—one
which could keep at a distance or at one stroke
lay low the sturdiest onslaught. For it was well
known that many of the pest-stricken in their delirium
rushed into the street to die; that the passer-by
might at any moment be confronted by some miserable
wretch who, seized with madness, would rise
and clasp him in an embrace of hideous contagion.</p>

<p>As for the mumpers and rufflers, who were wont
to emerge at the darkening hours in the Fields—like
night-moths, no one knew where from—one
glance of this gentleman’s eye, not to speak of the
knowing gesture of the staff hand, would have
sufficed to bid even the stoutest of them pause and
be wiser than to meddle.</p>

<p>And so Lionel Ratcliffe passed on, without undue
haste, leaving the closed theatre on his left, making
westward toward Arch Row. And presently, as
he emerged from the shadow of the trees, he sighted
the mansion that was his goal, Chillingburgh House,
with its sharp roof, its coping balustrade and urns
rising in relief, black against the lurid orange of the
sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>As he approached the gateway a sedan chair,
escorted by a couple of armed footmen, was just
depositing a lady voluminously wrapped in a silk
cloak before the double flight of steps. He halted
for a second to watch her begin the ascent on the
right. She went slowly, as one fatigued; he swiftly
entered the flagged courtyard, took the opposite side
of the stairs, and reached the landing just before
her.</p>

<p>“Madame de Mantes! … your servant—!
Punctual to the moment!” cried he, bowed and
clapped the feathered hat against his breast.</p>

<p>She halted on the last step and raised her handsome
head slowly toward him, ignoring his hand. The
light was growing dim, and the rosy folds of her hood
looked grey; but even under its shadows and in
spite of the rouge on her cheek he had an uncomfortable
impression of her pallor.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Oui</i>,” she said tonelessly, “<i lang="fr">me voici</i>.” Then,
with sudden petulance, “Ouf! but one suffocates
in this air!”</p>

<p>She caught at the strings of her cloak and tore them
apart; the light silken thing slipped from her shoulders,
but she hurried into the house as one unseeing.
Ratcliffe picked up the garment alertly, and followed,
just in time to offer his hand again at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
great staircase. The touch of her fingers struck
chill. His first misgivings deepened; but he quickly
dismissed the rising thoughts. Bah! a woman in
love (what was there about this Rockhurst, curse
him! that all the fair should thus run mad upon
him?)—a woman hopelessly in love, and a Frenchwoman
at that! There would sure be scenes with
the faithless lover, and she was even now rehearsing
them in her agitated imagination. Well might her
hands be cold.</p>

<p>“Are you ill at ease?” he whispered, with a perfunctory
show of solicitude as they passed a couple of
anxious-looking servants and drew closer together on
the stairs.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> but not at all!” she mocked him
irritably. “Neither ill in my ease, nor my heart,
nor—oh, tranquillise yourself—nor in my head!
Besides, who could be but well and happy in this
merry London of yours?”</p>

<p>They had reached the gallery. She snapped her
hand from his and dropped him a courtesy. He
wondered to have thought her pale; now she seemed
to him unwontedly flushed. Her heavy eyes shot fire.
Appraising her critically, he approved. There were
jewels at her ears and throat; her gown had the impress
of French taste, and became her every beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The grey-haired butler who flung open the doors
of the drawing-room at her approach looked after the
swaying, shimmering figure with melancholy approval.</p>

<p>“’Tis almost like old times, Master Lionel,”
he whispered, as Ratcliffe passed in, “to see a Court
lady about the place again.”</p>

<p>“Aye, from Court she is,” said Lady Chillingburgh’s
grandson, halting on the threshold to let his
gaze roam thankfully over the great white-and-gold
room, which had a sense of coolness and repose about
it, even on such a night. “But she had her reasons
for not hasting off with the rest of them this morning.”</p>

<p>“Eh—but they must be weighty reasons!”
murmured the old servant, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“No doubt the lady thinks them so,” said Lionel
Ratcliffe, with his detached laugh.—“We are full
early here, ’twould seem,” he added in louder
tones, advancing toward the card-table in the window
before which the Frenchwoman had already
taken seat.</p>

<p>But she disdained to cast toward him even the
flutter of an eyelid. Her fingers were moving
restlessly among the cards and dice.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Zero … zero! Hein? Non-zero. Ah …
mal-chance!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The man stood over her a second or two in silence.
Then sat down in his turn and faced her. His
voice rang out with a kind of empty cheeriness:—</p>

<p>“What! to the dice already?—Nay,” here he
leaned across the narrow space and whispered,
“Remember, it was to play another game that I
brought you here.”</p>

<p>She turned petulantly from him; then her eye
became fixed, staring out through the unshuttered
window.</p>

<p>“What a strange red moon is rising!” she cried.
“Would to God, Monsieur Ratcliffe, you had never
come to me this morning, tempting, tempting.…
My boxes were packed: I should be now far from
this pit of pestil—”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” he warned, finger on lip.
“Not here! Do not forget my instructions.” Then,
in his low, mock-gallant accents: “How now?
Is the game, then, no longer worth the hazard?”</p>

<p>She caught up the dice-box again, feverishly:—</p>

<p>“Yes—yes. But I have no luck to-night!”</p>

<p>She muttered and cast. “Naught again!”</p>

<p>“Expect you luck at the game of chance,” quoth
he, catching the dice-box from her hand, “when you
are so lucky at the game of love?”</p>

<p>“I? I, lucky?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” proceeded he; “and have you not had
Cupid’s best cards in your hand, since the very
hour of your landing with Madame de France?
First the King—King of Trumps himself, and eke
the Queen.—Gad, she’d have loved you, were it
but to spite the Castlemaine.—Then—”</p>

<p>“Tush!” she interrupted angrily. “Cards?—’Tis
not all to hold the cards—one must play them.
I held them all, in truth—” she put her hand to her
throat with a little choking sob. “But—”</p>

<p>“You threw them all down!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i lang="fr">ciel</i>!—When the heart begins to take a part
in this game of love, then all goes astray.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” repeated the man, steadily, his hard eyes
upon her, “you threw your cards away—and all
for love of this Rockhurst, the greatest knave in the
pack.”</p>

<p>She turned with sudden anger:—</p>

<p>“Knave, sir? Sho!… King of you all!”
Then, with equally sudden change of mood, “Oh,
he <em>is</em> a villain!” she moaned, and her lip trembled
upon tears.</p>

<p>“And so you have not seen him,” said he, altering
his tone to one of elaborate sympathy, “since he
returned to town, escorting to his house my fair
cousin, Diana Harcourt? What—not once, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
all you have given up for him?—Faith, ’tis ungallant
of him!”</p>

<p>Her elbows on the table, her chin sunk in her
hands, she was now staring fiercely into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Your promise, sir, that I meet him here to-night?…”</p>

<p>“Nay, I can only tell you, my fair Jeanne, that
he journeys hither from the Tower or Whitehall
twice a day—when ’tis not thrice.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> …” she breathed between her
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the temper he had aroused in her,
the man withdrew his eyes, turned sideways on his
chair, and crossed his legs.</p>

<p>“I fear you’ve been too cool with him,” he
remarked airily. “Our ‘merry Rockhurst,’ as
his Majesty calls him, is used to a vast deal of
warmth.”</p>

<p>“I—too cool!” She laughed hysterically. “Oh,
yes, it was that, of course, with this heart and brain
of mine on fire!”</p>

<p>“Then I fear,” said Ratcliffe, on the edge
of a yawn, “you’ve been too hot. The Lord
Constable of his Majesty’s Tower is a man of
niceties.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Ratcliffe,” cried Jeanne de Mantes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
beating the table with her palm and darting her
head toward him like a pretty serpent, “you are
the Devil!”</p>

<p>“And your very good friend, madam.” He
smiled with a charming bow. “Come, come!
Smooth that fair brow. Do you doubt but you can
hold your own against a mere country widow?”</p>

<p>She fixed him with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>“Aye, and now it comes to me,” she cried resentfully.
“What is your motive in all this, Monsieur
Ratcliffe? Not simply sympathy for me?”</p>

<p>“Come, come! Be calm.” There was authority
under his blandness. “Be calm,” he repeated,
“and let me whisper in your ear.—I will even
trust you with my innermost thought. Diana Harcourt
shall not be for my Lord Rockhurst, but for
your humble servant.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” she commented, a twist of scorn upon her
lips; “the lady, I was told, is passing rich.”</p>

<p>“Even so,” returned he, unmoved. “’Twould
indeed be impossible to conceal aught from your
perspicacity!—Now Mistress Harcourt, by an odd
trick of fate, has become affianced to Harry Rockhurst,
the virtuous, innocent country son of this
most reprobate nobleman. The which, however,
would be but a small matter (for she loves not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
green lad, mark you, nor ever will), were it not the
spur to other feelings.”</p>

<p>“I fail to follow you, sir,” she said wearily.</p>

<p>“Nay, a moment’s patience, pretty huntress, then
you will come full on the scent. My Lord Rockhurst
has had the singular maggot of playing a game
of parental virtue with his heir.—But you are not
listening.”</p>

<p>She was pressing her temples with the tip of her
fingers, as one who fights a stabbing pain. At his
words, she looked up again and nodded; and he
went on:—</p>

<p>“He has pledged himself to guard the goddess
for his lad in the maze of the town. Mistress
Diana has seen naught of my Lord Constable but
the high-souled knight, the King Arthur of romance,
and so he would fain remain in her eyes even as in
those of his son; and thus he, whom the town
has dubbed Rakehell Rockhurst, caught in his own
springe, must go on playing the pattern of chivalry,
the virtuous gentleman, the devoted father—play
his part out, in fact, or else be dubbed now prince of
hypocrites! Aye, and the cream of the jest is that
they have fallen both so mad in love with each
other, aha! that each can scarce breathe in the
other’s presence for the weight of the secret!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed, but she brooded darkly, nibbling
at her little finger.</p>

<p>“And so,” she said after a pause, “you count upon
me to lure back my lord?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” retorted he, with a great show of ease.
“That—or else to pluck the mask of grave virtue
from his face … in Mistress Harcourt’s presence.
Was it not agreed? Either course, I take it, will
serve your purpose as well as mine. Why—I
deemed you subtler, madam! Upon my Lord
Constable’s discomfiture; upon the opening of
my fair prude’s eyes, strikes my hour, I say. And,
zounds, I take it!—Strikes your moment, too,
so you know how to clutch it! Do you not see
that?”</p>

<p>She made no answer. A meaningless laugh was
on her lips; it died in a sigh. A strange feeling as
of soaring and undulation had come upon her, and a
splitting of her thoughts as though she were in two
places at once. Her mind was wandering oddly,
beyond her control, to the cool meadows of her childhood’s
home, to the days when she plucked daisies
with her baby brother in the dew-wet grass. Lionel
Ratcliffe was still speaking; she caught a word
here and there. One phrase at last fixed her attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Twill go hard,” he was saying, “if Lionel
Ratcliffe comes not to his own to-night!”</p>

<p>“And Jeanne de Mantes to hers!” she cried then,
in a kind of high-strained voice, rousing herself.
And, falling back into her abstraction: “What a
wicked mist there rises from the garden,” she went
on, complaining. “Aye, would I were far from
here!”</p>

<p>“And let pious Mistress Harcourt convert my
Lord Constable?”</p>

<p>“A plague on you!” she shrieked in a sudden
frenzy.</p>

<p>“Hush, hush! That word—have you forgot?”</p>

<p>A shadow fell on them as they leaned together.
She looked up in terror. It was only the old butler,
with a whispered message from Lady Chillingburgh
to her grandson.</p>

<p>Lionel frowned: the interruption was unwelcome.
He glanced at the clock, it was the hour of the reception;
the guests would presently arrive, and he
mistrusted the Frenchwoman’s tact, above all to-night,
in this unwonted vapourish mood. He rose
with ill humour.</p>

<p>“Some whimsy of my grandam about the tables,
no doubt,” he muttered, as he sauntered from the
room, pausing at the door to cast a last look of warning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
And, truly,—for Fate plays such tricks upon
those who would guide her,—scarce had his footsteps
died away, when Lord Rockhurst himself
entered unannounced upon the solitary guest, as
enters the familiar of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="LADY_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">LOVE’S REPROACH</span></h3>

<p>He reached the middle of the room before he
caught sight of her. An angry frown suddenly
overcast features which, in repose, were at once
singularly dignified and melancholy.</p>

<p>“How now?” he said harshly. “How come you
here?”</p>

<p>Whatever illusion Jeanne de Mantes might have
cherished as to her power over the man she loved,
that frown, the cutting tones, all too quickly dispelled
it. She felt as one who, stretching her cheek
for a kiss, receives a blow. Ingrate! And she
who, this day, was braving death to see him once
more! Quick upon the smart of pain, her fury rose.
Squaring her elbows, she looked at him insolently.</p>

<p>“Why, in my sedan chair, milord.”</p>

<p>“Who brought you, then?”</p>

<p>But she had not the strength for the fight. What
had come to Jeanne de Mantes? She found herself
faltering:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, say <em>what</em> brought me, Rockhurst, and I
will tell you. It was to see you.” Her voice deepened,
the tears she would not shed wept in it. “I
was packing, if you would know, for country and
safety, even this morning. And when Mr. Ratcliffe
told me—”</p>

<p>“Ha!” he interrupted, speaking half to himself,
“I might have known who had baited this trap.”</p>

<p>She went on with rising plaint:—</p>

<p>“Oh! What have I done to thee, my friend—?”</p>

<p>“This is no place for you, madam,” he said,
coming close to her and speaking very low. “A
house you have no right to enter.”</p>

<p>The colour flamed up again to her face.</p>

<p>“Nay, if you are here, milord,” she retorted,
“why not I, then?”</p>

<p>He stood a few seconds, his dark eye upon her,
deeply thinking; then, as though upon a sudden,
wilful mood, a complete change came over him. The
stateliness, the air of command, the something unapproachable
as of one set apart, gave place to
mockery, to languor. He let himself sink upon the
chair that Ratcliffe had vacated; and, running his
fingers through the black curls that lay on his shoulders,
scrutinised her again insolently through half-closed
lids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lionel Ratcliffe,” quoth he then, “is a gentleman
of birth and parts. And if he hath not much
of this world’s goods, he hath wits, which is nigh as
good. Mightest do worse, Jinny!”</p>

<p>“And is it for this,” cried she, laughing loudly,
“that I gave up a king?” But in the midst of her
laughter tears welled and ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry!” he said, wilfully hard,
“but this becomes a wearisome refrain of thine!
What now, Old Rowley is forgiving. Finish that
packing of thine, and hie thee to Salisbury. You
might still—”</p>

<p>She caught her kerchief from her bosom and set
her teeth in it.</p>

<p>“Might I, indeed, my lord? Oh, you are gallant!”
Then the tears came on that hysteric outburst:
“You will break my heart!”</p>

<p>He glanced anxiously toward the door.</p>

<p>“Tush!—Hearts?” he cried impatiently. “We
are set with five senses in this world, and ’tis but
common wisdom to take note of them. But hearts?
What have you and I to do with hearts?”</p>

<p>“And, indeed,” she sobbed—“and, indeed, I
never knew I had one, till you had taken it from me!”</p>

<p>“Dry your eyes, Jinny,” said he then, not unkindly.
“When will ye women learn it?—tears are daggers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
with which ye slay your charms.… Enough!
I for one never could abide a salt cheek.”</p>

<p>She thrust back the sob rising in her throat, and
strove to smile upon him.</p>

<p>“Time was you thought me handsome,” she
murmured with catching breath.</p>

<p>“I think thee handsome still,” he answered;
stretched out a languid finger and touched her chin.
Then a bitter laugh shook him. “A morsel fit for a
king, as I said!”</p>

<p>With her snakelike movement she rose, and stood
a second, glaring down at him. Then to her ears
came a rustle along the oaken boards of the passage.
Her rival! And she, <i lang="fr">la belle</i> Jeanne de Mantes,
tear-stained, a hideous thing to be mocked at! Like
a hunted thing, she turned and dashed through
the open window out upon the terrace that overlooked
the gloom of the garden.</p>

<p class="tb">No fresh air there to cool her fevered temples,
to revive that heart so strangely labouring. But
stronger than all physical discomfort was the galling
interest of her jealousy. She returned close to the
window by which she had fled.… The mischief
of it was that, with this hammering of her pulses,
she could scarce catch a word of what passed within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the room. But she could see! And the whole life
power in her became concentrated in her burning
eyes. Pshaw! it was but a pale girl when all was
said and done! And the hair, positive red!…
Aye, and overlong in the limb—an English gawk!
She would call herself slender, no doubt—thin was
the word for her. Not a jewel, not even a pearl, on
the forehead! If Jeanne de Mantes knew milord—him
so travelled, so fastidious, so <i lang="fr">raffiné</i>—this dish
of curds and whey would mighty soon pall upon his
palate. Yet, through all this tale of her rival’s
disabilities, a relentless voice, far away in her soul,
yet clear as judge’s sentence, repeated that Diana
was beautiful and held Rockhurst’s love. In her
despair, something like madness ran hot through
her veins. Very well, at any rate, as Lionel Ratcliffe
had it, her moment was at hand! A shuddering
fit came over her that seemed to shake her
ideas away, as an autumn wind the leaves.…
Her moment? What moment…?</p>

<p class="tb">In the yellow candle-light within, Lord Rockhurst
had ceremoniously greeted his son’s betrothed.
Silently she courtesied. Then, as they drew closer
to each other, the man saw traces of tears on the
fair cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is this?” he exclaimed. “You have been
weeping!”</p>

<p>“Truly, my lord,” said she, smiling, yet with a
little catch in her breath, “I should be ashamed to
show you this disfigured countenance.”</p>

<p>“Disfigured?” he echoed. “Nay—transfigured!”</p>

<p>He took a quick step toward her as she spoke;
but she drew back.</p>

<p>“I have a letter from Harry,” she said constrainedly;
and Rockhurst drew himself up, darkening.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said he, and then approached her again,
his whole manner delicately, indescribably altered.
“Good news, I trust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, vastly,” she answered, with a small, flustered
laugh, drawing a folded sheet from her bosom.
There was a deep pause. “I am glad to have heard
from Harry,” she declared of a sudden, bravely.</p>

<p>“So glad,” he said, low-voiced, “that you wept.”</p>

<p>“My lord!” There was fear and warning in her
cry.</p>

<p>“Ah, Diana, do not grudge me your tears, since
’tis all I may ever have from you!” He took a
hasty turn about the room,—his eyes averted, not
to read in her countenance the effect of this cry of
revelation. When he came back to her, iron composure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was once more upon him. “I, too, heard from
my son. Harry clamours to be allowed to join us.
That may not be. Less than ever now!” A church
bell rang mournfully into his last words. “Why,
hark! the very bells ring out the words, plague,
plague!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my good lord!” she exclaimed, her finger
on her lip.</p>

<p>“Aye, and is my Lady Chillingburgh still so
mad?”</p>

<p>“Mad? No; but all London is gone mad, is
labouring under a monstrous illusion. We, in this
house, alone are sane. There never was such an
ailment as the—” she dropped and formed the
evil word only with a movement of the lips. “And
if, as you see, our friends grow scarcer each Wednesday
night, there are a thousand indifferent good
reasons to explain their absence.”</p>

<p>Something in the sweet, assumed archness of her
tone stirred him as could no outburst of feminine
terror.</p>

<p>“Diana, child, I cannot permit this! You must
not remain exposed to such peril. I will no longer
be withheld from speaking to Lady Chillingburgh.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, my lord,” she prayed him earnestly,
“you would but anger her; you would but be banished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
this house, and nothing gained indeed. Oh,
do not speak!”</p>

<p>He took both her hands as she involuntarily flung
them out.</p>

<p>“Then will I speak to you only. Diana, think of
yourself, of Harry. The whole town is in flight.
The departure of the Court has given the final signal
for panic—”</p>

<p>She smiled as she slowly withdrew her hands.</p>

<p>“And you, my lord, when do you join the fugitives?”</p>

<p>“I?” He started. “Why, surely, madam, you
know I have a post to keep! ’Tis one I would not
desert if I might. My men, poor devils, look to
me—”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she interrupted, “and have I no post to
hold against the same enemy? How many servants
would my grandmother retain if I set the example?”</p>

<p>“Diana!” The word escaped him in an uncontrollable
impulse of tenderness. But he checked
himself again on the very leap of passion. “Ah,”
he murmured, “I shall have a brave daughter!”</p>

<p>She smiled, as a woman smiles at the hurt inflicted
by the best-beloved.</p>

<p>There came from without the sound of voices,
uplifted in the pleasant, artificial accents that mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the social meeting, and Lionel Ratcliffe ushered a
couple of elderly visitors into the room with his
elaborate, if ironic, courtesy.</p>

<p>“You are not the first, gentlemen, you perceive.
Indeed, my worthy ancestress is somewhat behind-hand
in her usual punctilio. But she has been engaged
(with my assistance) in the dismissal of a saucy
footman who has had the insolence to remark to her
upon these red crosses with which it hath become the
rage to adorn the doors of certain houses these days.”</p>

<p>Both the men laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” cried the elder and stouter, and
sniffed surreptitiously at his pomander box.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” assented Lionel, suavely.</p>

<p>Whereupon the other guest broke out, as in
anger:—</p>

<p>“A monstrous nuisance, ’pon honour! Gad, sirs,
I am here straight from a crony’s house—my
Lord Vernon’s and no other. What think you
greets me from the door-step—a nobleman’s door,
mark you! The cross, sir, the cross! and by my
soul, the text, ‘<em>Lord have mercy on us!</em>’ writ beneath
in chalk!”</p>

<p>“Lord ’a’ mercy!” exclaimed the stout man,
starting back involuntarily. “You did not cross
the threshold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Mr. Foulkes,” returned the younger severely.
Then he burst forth again, a man mightily offended
by the indelicacy of events: “Gad, sir, I’m not fond
of the country, but I’m for it to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Foulkes again sniffed his spice-box, this time
openly.</p>

<p>“Why, so am I, Sir John!—Ah, Mistress Harcourt,
your humble devoted!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, who had anxiously looked round the
room for Madame de Mantes, while the guests
exchanged greetings, now saw her emerge from
the window recess, and threw her a keen, enquiring
glance. Without meeting his eyes, she came forward
with a great rustle of ballooning silk so that all
turned toward her.</p>

<p>“Pray, Mr. Ratcliffe,” said she, in a gay and
coquettish voice, “you have not yet presented me to
your kinswoman.”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe shot swift scrutiny from beneath his
drawn brows at Diana’s surprised face, at Lord
Rockhurst’s dark, impassive countenance and the
Frenchwoman’s crimson cheeks and haggard eyes,
imperceptibly shrugged his shoulders, and complied:—</p>

<p>“Cousin Diana—Madame de Mantes, who is
kind enough to add her charming presence to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
dwindling company to-night. Agreeably to our
grandmother’s wish, I have been acting herald to her
hospitality.”</p>

<p>Jeanne sank into the centre of her amber and
blue draperies; emerged languorous, extended with
queenly grace a hand to Foulkes and another to Sir
John, and from the very sweep of her courtesies
flung a condescending phrase at her rival:—</p>

<p>“Monsieur, your handsome cousin, has been so
eloquent about you, madam, that ’tis almost as if
I knew you already.”</p>

<p>“He is very kind,” faltered Diana, ill at ease,
she scarce knew why. Then, mindful of her duty
as hostess, “You know my Lord Rockhurst?”</p>

<p>The lady looked beyond them into the night of the
garden.</p>

<p>“We <em>have</em> met,” she said in dreamy tones, and
sailed into a third obeisance.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen of the Court instinctively drew
together.</p>

<p>“What has come to that pretty piece from France?
Her looks are oddly altered, think you not? And
her manner is somewhat singular to-night. What
makes she in this prim circle? She should be at
Salisbury,” whispered Foulkes.</p>

<p>Sir John Farringdon jerked his thumb knowingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
toward the Lord Constable; both looked, laughed,
and wagged their heads. Rockhurst stepped forward
and unostentatiously drew Diana away from
Madame de Mantes. Lionel seized his moment:—</p>

<p>“What did you, from the room?” he whispered
hurriedly in his ally’s ear. “You had your chance,
and let it slip! I had not brought you here—”
He stopped suddenly, staring at her askance. The
great enamel clasp, that held the artfully careless
draperies at her breast, rose and fell with her over-quick
breathing, yet her mood was strangely cheerful;
nay, incomprehensible, for he marked that her
eyes were red. She had wept, he angrily thought,
and robbed herself well-nigh of all her beauty.
“You’ve lost the trick for both of us,” he muttered
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” she bade him, drawing closer
to him. “Look at them!” she cried, tossing her
curls in the direction of Rockhurst and Diana.
“Ha! you’d have me believe Rockhurst in love—in
love with that white, bloodless, fireless country
stock! Oh, sir, I have seen Rockhurst in love!”</p>

<p>A smile twisted his lips; he looked at her cruelly.</p>

<p>She proceeded with a mixture of exultation and
bitterness:—</p>

<p>“I watched them; they thought themselves alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
I tell you he made no attempt to do more than kiss
her finger-tips! Ah, <i lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>!” Her laughter
was like a flame running through her. “With me—Ah,
you men! do I not know you?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said Ratcliffe, deliberately. “Something
you may know of us, and know well. But
you know not what a virtuous woman can make of
us.”</p>

<p>She wheeled on him, clenching her hands as though
to strike him.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” she panted. “And have I not had
as much virtue as any woman—once?” Then,
finding his gaze fixed upon his cousin, she halted
upon precipitate speech, watched him keenly for a
second, and broke into loud laughter.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he cried, starting at the wanton sound.</p>

<p>“Excellent Lionel,” she said, catching him with
her small, burning fingers, “if friends are to help
each other, they should be frank. But now I know
your secret, I know where I am. As Heaven is
good to me,” her laugh rang out again, “’tis not for
the money; why, ’tis for love! You’re in love with
the widow!”</p>

<p>He looked at her for an instant as if he could have
stabbed her willingly, but the next fell back into his
cynic mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Congratulate yourself, then,” he retorted drily,
“since I have all the more reason to have my way.
But, pray you, here comes my grandam. She
cares not for such loud mirth.”</p>

<p>“Trust me,” she tittered. “I await but the ripe
moment. The unmasking shall yet be played to
your liking, and—” She faltered; into her eyes
came the vagueness, into her voice the singular
change, that once or twice already had aroused
Ratcliffe’s attention. In a kind of toneless whisper,
rapid and jerky, she added: “Unmask? Oh, yes,
milord. No doubt—after supper!”</p>

<p>Lionel fell back with a frown of dismay.</p>

<p>The folding doors were thrown apart; two footmen
entered, bearing candelabra which they deposited
upon the centre card-table. There was an
abrupt cessation of talk among the guests, and all
turned in formal expectation of the venerable hostess’s
entry. Into which stillness Lady Chillingburgh,
seated very upright in her chair, was wheeled by a
negro boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="LADY_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PLAGUE-CART</span></h3>

<p>Through the fantastic mists that circled in her
brain to-night, now shrouding her faculties in gloom
like the sinister fog that hung without, now shot
as with many-coloured fires, Madame de Mantes
gazed upon this extraordinary personality.</p>

<p>Paralysed to the waist though the old lady was, a
fierce vitality, an indomitable will, looked out of the
sunken black eyes, spoke in the cavernous voice,
imposed itself in the gesture of the shriveled hand.
Here was one, in spite of age and infirmity, strong
enough to bid defiance to universal calamity, to
look Pestilence in the face, and choose to ignore it;
who, in the midst of a terror akin to that of the
scriptural last day—when the abomination of
desolation seemed to have fallen upon the city, and
he that was on the housetop might scarce come down
to take anything out of his house—could still give
her weekly card-party and find guests to obey the
summons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>As her chair was brought to a stand in the middle
of the room, Lady Chillingburgh drew her eyebrows
together and swept a slow, severe glance over the
circle.</p>

<p>“I was informed the company had assembled.
How now! Are these all my guests?”</p>

<p>There was a kind of apologetic stir, as if each
person felt responsible for the paucity of the gathering.
Then Rockhurst and the other men advanced
and gravely paid their devoirs. Diana drew her
grandmother’s chair to a more suitable position
by the big card-table, and stood behind her, in
attendance. Ratcliffe instantly proceeded to the
introduction of the new guest. He was once more
suave, to glibness:—</p>

<p>“The Court has left this morning, dear madam;
hence this unwonted emptiness of your rooms.
Nevertheless, here is a lady of the royal circle.
Madame de Mantes, of the house of Madame Henriette
de France, and honoured by their Majesties’
particular regard—she still prefers the advantages
of the town.”</p>

<p>The aged face became wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>“I trust their Majesties were in good health,
madam, when last you saw them,” said my Lady
Chillingburgh in stately condescension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeanne courtesied mechanically. She felt of a sudden
childishly afraid of the figure in the chair, old,
old and nearly dead, yet so alive!</p>

<p>The faint, hollow voice went on, as from the
recesses of a tomb:—</p>

<p>“You play cards, of course, Madame de Mantes!”
To which the other made answer feebly, into
space:—</p>

<p>“Yes … yes, milady. I came to play.”</p>

<p>A slight shade of surprise appeared in the hostess’s
eyes; but after a second, she made another gesture
with the clawlike hand, and turned with an unerring
precision of politeness to her friends:—</p>

<p>“Sir John, I rejoice to see you; you had failed us
of late. Ah, Mr. Foulkes, you indeed are ever
faithful! But where is your good lady?”</p>

<p>“She deemed it wiser—hem,” Foulkes coughed,
a-sweat with embarrassment, “I mean, she had
accepted an invitation to the country, and left this
morning with our family.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” commented the venerable hostess,
regally. “My Lord Rockhurst, you prefer basset,
I know. So does Sir John. Will you be seated
yonder? Grandson, to my left. Madame, will
you face me, if you please? Mr. Foulkes, sir, to
my right. Diana, child, shuffle the cards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>They fell into their places as she willed them;
and for a little while round the greater table there
was naught but the business of the moment: the
necessary words of the game, the rattle of the dice,
the whisper of sliding cards. Diana, her fresh
young beauty drawn close in startling contrast to
her grandmother’s awe-inspiring face, held the cards
for the trembling fingers, flung the dice.</p>

<p>In the window recess, the two men, under cover
of a languid contest, conversed gravely in undertones.
But ever and again the Lord Constable’s
gaze, charged with anxiety, sought Diana’s radiant
head. Jeanne had flung herself feverishly into the
game, which seemed to her all at once a matter of
colossal importance.</p>

<p>“I marvel extremely,” quoth Lady Chillingburgh,
“that my Lord Marsham should be so late. You
are acquaint with my Lord Marsham, madame?
He is much at Whitehall. We are indeed a small
party to-night. Let us hope my lord will presently
appear.”</p>

<p>Foulkes, who had shown increasing agitation
during this speech, now dropped his cards with a
muffled “Mercy be good to us!”</p>

<p>Ratcliffe kicked him under the table, the while
addressing his bland tones to his grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not expect his lordship to-night, madam.
I hear he has convened a party of his own.”</p>

<p>Sir John Farringdon, straining startled ears and
eyes from the other table, caught Ratcliffe’s glance,
and mouthed at him with dumb lips, “Gone?”—jerking
heavenward with his thumb.</p>

<p>“Gone,” asserted Ratcliffe’s nod, while his thumb
pointed grimly down.</p>

<p>Lady Chillingburgh turned her quick glance, her
high pyramid of lace and white curls, in daunting
enquiry toward Sir John. But her grandson, diabolically
fluent, was once more ready with his irony:—</p>

<p>“Sir John is offended at having received no
invitation.”</p>

<p>“’Tis very strange,” said Lady Chillingburgh.
“My Lord Marsham is not wont to be discourteous.”</p>

<p>“’Twas such a sudden inspiration,” soothed Lionel.</p>

<p>His grandmother fixed him with stern disapproval.
Diana sometimes thought that, though it was the old
woman’s fancy to be humoured, not a jot of their
elaborate pretence escaped her; that she fiercely
resented the mocking manner with which Lionel
acted his rôle.</p>

<p>“And your cousin, sir? Where lurks he? Your
brother Edward, I mean, Diana?”</p>

<p>And as Diana had no answer but a look of dumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
distress, the old lady finished the phrase for herself:—</p>

<p>“I fear young Edward can find little time for the
duties he owes to his grandmother, for the claims
of a genteel society, so eager is he, since he is come
to London, for less reputable amusements!” Again
the fiery eyes wandered, seeking. “And Mistress
Hill? ’Tis the first time in seven years that Mistress
Hill has failed me.”</p>

<p>Sir John Farringdon, who had been unaccountably
nettled by Ratcliffe’s mocking remark, here
lifted his voice somewhat overloudly:—</p>

<p>“I can give tidings of Mistress Hill, madam. I
happen to know that this evening she was driven out
in state. No doubt, Mr. Ratcliffe, ’twas to join
that gathering of my Lord Marsham’s to which, as
you were good enough to inform the company, I
was not asked.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst rose, frowning. And, laughing, not
pleasantly, at his own wit, Sir John gathered the
neglected stakes and slipped them into his pocket.
Madame de Mantes echoed the laugh, shrilly,
hysterically.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> How amusing you all are!” she
cried, and furtively wiped her forehead, wet with
unaccountably cold clamminess this sultry night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>A dark flush crept to the old hostess’s bleached
cheek. Desultory talk or grim jest failed alike to
relieve the tension. The game languished; scarce
passed a card or rang a die; the ever-shadowing
Horror hung, nightmare-dark, ever closer, ever
more palpable, over all.</p>

<p>“The game, madam! The game, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>But it was idle, even for the bravest spirit among
her guests, to deny the invisible Presence in their
midst. And when, following upon a confused rumour
on the stairs, a great cry of anguish and terror
was raised at the very door of the room; when,
staggering and wringing his hands, a distraught
youth rushed in, it was almost as if his voice was
that of the unacknowledged Fear; his livid face its
very countenance.</p>

<p>“For the Lord’s sake, a cup of the plague water!”</p>

<p>“Brother!” cried Diana. She sprang toward
him. But hastily, even roughly, Rockhurst thrust
her on one side, and the boy collapsed into the
nearest chair.</p>

<p>Whereupon Lionel, coming forward with his
usual coolness, ran his fingers, with a movement
the sinister significance of which most people had
learned to interpret these days, under the fair curls
of the bent head, feeling behind the ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pshaw—’tis nothing!… Sheer poltroonery,”
cried he, and laughed loudly, and struck his
cousin’s hunched shoulders with no gentle hand.
“Art a pretty fellow to come thus, bellowing like a
calf, into the presence of ladies!”</p>

<p>“Curse it!” moaned the lad. “I have just
knocked against two women carrying a coffin!
They howled like sick cats.” Sinking his head on
his hands once more, he rocked himself backward
and forward. “Oh, this wicked London! Oh, the
judgment of God!”</p>

<p>“Edward!” cried Lady Chillingburgh imperiously.
Her voice dominated the horrified whispers of Sir
John and Foulkes, Madame de Mantes’s hysterical
cries, young Edward’s obtrusive groans.</p>

<p>But there was a force stronger than her in her
house that night. Sir John Farringdon unceremoniously
poured himself a bumper of wine, drank
it hastily, his eye on the door toward which Foulkes
was already uneasily edging. Madame de Mantes,
who had been sobbing out inarticulate words in her
own tongue, broke into babbling laughter.</p>

<p>Edward sprang to his feet, thrusting aside his
cousin’s restraining hand.</p>

<p>“I will speak! Grandam shall hear the truth at
last! ’Tis everywhere! Every one is getting it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Lord Marsham, ill at noon, dead at four! Mistress
Hill, well yesterday, buried to-night!”</p>

<p>“I command you to silence, Edward!”</p>

<p>The quavering voice rose high, catching painfully
at lost authority; the palsied hand aimed a feeble
blow at the table.</p>

<p>“Why must we stay, because of the old woman’s
whimsy?” continued the boy in fury. “Zounds!
I go to-night, and sister with me. D’ye hear,
grandam! I’m only come here to get the travel
money from you, and I’ll have it. I’ll go, and
sister with me!”</p>

<p>But the aged queen was not yet dethroned. Her
spirit asserted itself in a supreme effort. Life
seemed to come back to her paralysed limbs; she
flung out one hand in a gesture of authority; this
time it scarce trembled.</p>

<p>“Diana, your brother is drunk. I order him to be
expelled. Mr. Foulkes, the game is not concluded;
resume your seat!”</p>

<p>She broke off. Sir John Farringdon had made
a sudden unmannerly dash from the room. Foulkes
stood at command with a sickly smile; but his
friend’s example, the open passage, were too much
for him; stealthily the door closed upon his retreat.</p>

<p>Only by a rigid aversion of her head did Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Chillingburgh betray her knowledge of this double
defection.</p>

<p>“Grandson Lionel, your cousin Edward is drunk.
Conduct him, I say, from this apartment and let him
be physicked. Madam, I am surprised you find
amusement in such an indecorous scene. Foh!
It seems truly that we shall have no cards to-night.
Diana, child, take your guitar and sing for us.
Sing that old sweet song of Master Herrick’s.—My
Lord Rockhurst, have you yet heard this new
instrument?”</p>

<p>But the Lord Constable had followed Diana as she
moved across the room to seek the guitar. They
stood together a second; he saw her hand tremble
over the olive-wood case.</p>

<p>“Nay, child, you can never sing to-night!” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“My lord, I must—anything to soothe her. Oh,
the physicians have ever warned us of the danger
of agitation for her!”</p>

<p>“Diana!” Lady Chillingburgh’s voice was weak
and strained; her face seemed to have suddenly
shrunk; extinct was the fire in the eyes. Yet the
will still struggled. “Sing!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst stood behind Diana, a strong, quiet
presence, watchful, comforting. She smiled at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
over her shoulder. He bent to her, and under cover
of the first chords:—</p>

<p>“You, at least, are not afraid?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, my lord.”</p>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe had taken no pains to fulfil his
grandmother’s behest; and already she seemed to
have forgotten it; but he had soothed Edward
Hare after his own fashion—by a bumper of wine
and a whispered promise to provide the travel money
himself. Now in the lull he took a seat behind
Madame de Mantes and, his eyes on Rockhurst and
Diana, began in a fierce undertone:—</p>

<p>“Do you not see how it is with them? Why, in
this evening’s folly everything conspires to give them
to each other. You wait the ripe moment, say you?
Gad! Look there, I say: there is that other woman
with the man you love—claim him now! ’Tis
your last chance!”</p>

<p>Madame de Mantes, who, since Lady Chillingburgh’s
rebuke, had been sitting, her chin propped
up on her hands, her curls concealing her face,
turned slowly toward him. He started. For all
his fortitude a shudder ran through him.—Through
her mad eyes the Pestilence was looking upon him!</p>

<p class="tb">Diana’s voice rose faint but sweet:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Lady Chillingburgh, with closed lids, beat time
vaguely on the arm of her chair; Edward Hare
pondered over his last mouthful of wine; the Frenchwoman
was muttering to herself and drawing, under
the shadow of the curls, restless patterns on the table
with her forefinger. Lionel sat beside her, his
starting eyes upon her face.</p>

<p class="noindent">sang Diana, in a voice that had grown firmer and
clearer.</p>

<p>And now, so faintly at first as to be almost imperceptible,
something began to mingle itself with the
music. The clang of a bell struck at intervals,
followed by a long, monotonous call. The sound
drew ever nearer. Diana faltered, took up her song
again bravely, failed once more, struck a broken
note; then hand and voice fell mute. Stillness
held them all within the great room, which seemed
to wait doom the more inevitably for its bright
lights, for its futile air of indifference and gaiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the open window, out of the darkness,
gathered a heavy rumble of wheels; then again
uprose the call of the bell, the cry of the hoarse
voice:—</p>

<p>“Bring out your dead!”</p>

<p>In the breathless pause, Lady Chillingburgh, rising
upon those feet that had been dead to motion so long,
stood erect, and flung out her arm with an angry cry;
and then it seemed there was naught in the big chair
but a huddled heap of drapery. The Terror, petrified
on young Hare’s lip, broke out roaring:—</p>

<p>“She’s dead also! Grandam’s dead! The
plague! She’s dead of the plague!” He made one
leap for the door, his screams awaking confusion in
the house.</p>

<p>Within Lady Chillingburgh’s drawing-room the
drama was quickly played.</p>

<p>Diana bent in anguish over her grandmother,
crying:—</p>

<p>“She has swooned! For Heaven’s sake, madame,
as you are a woman, give me your assistance!”</p>

<p>But Lionel had sprung to her side:—</p>

<p>“Back, Diana! Away out of this room. Our
grandmother is dead.”</p>

<p>“The—the sickness?” she faltered, with white
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“The plague? Not here—” he answered her.
“But there!” He flung his pointing finger toward
Jeanne de Mantes, who turned her face with a
crazy laugh toward them.</p>

<p>Diana recoiled a pace, threw out her hands as if
seeking support, and Rockhurst, ever close to her,
caught her in his arms as she swooned. A sudden,
blind, all-encompassing fury fell upon Ratcliffe.</p>

<p>“Stay, my Lord Constable!” he cried fiercely, and
made a spring to wrest the unconscious burden from
the hated man’s embrace. “Ah, Rakehell Rockhurst,
not so fast!”</p>

<p>The table was between them. He was wrenching
at his sword as he dashed round it, pushing Jeanne
de Mantes aside; when, with her soft, bare arms,
she clutched his throat from behind.</p>

<p>It was perhaps his horror of the embrace that
robbed him of the power of resistance; perhaps it
was the strength lent by the delirium that rendered
her burning clasp irresistible. He struggled, yet
was powerless. His starting eyes beheld the Lord
Constable pass out of the room to the garden, bearing
Diana into the night. He gathered his energy for
a last shout in the hope of raising the household to
his help; but the hot arms were writhing closer
about him, the scented curls beat softly against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
cheek. The creature was laughing, pressing upward
her disfigured face, devouring him with her
mad, unseeing eyes, striving to reach his lips for the
kiss of death.—And she was raving:—</p>

<p>“At last, O Rockhurst!… <i lang="fr">O mon beau Démon!</i>”</p>

<p>He never knew how he loosed himself—that
moment was blank, stamped with too deep a horror
to be ever recalled.</p>

<p>He found himself as in a nightmare rushing blindly
through the blackness of the fields, feeling as if
he could never escape from that lingering touch of
contamination, as if no waters could ever lave him
from the taint!</p>

<p class="tb">It was only when he was brought to a standstill
by the edge of the river, by the Essex stairs, that he
realised where his frenzy was taking him, and awoke,
as it were, to sanity. But it was with a trembling
in every limb and a weakness that forced him to sit
on the steps. The water lapped at his very feet,
shivering in a little circle of light cast by the stair
lantern. He dipped his hand in the dark ripple
and began mechanically to lave his brow—to lave,
above all, his lips.</p>

<p>Thought took coherent shape again.—This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the end of his close-set plans. Madame de Mantes
had failed him with a completeness it seemed that
must have required Satan’s own ingenuity to devise.
Lord Rockhurst had not been unmasked, Diana
was with him in his power,—and he, Lionel
Ratcliffe (God, with what appalling reason!), was
at last afraid of the plague!</p>

<h2>BROKEN SANCTUARY</h2>

<h3 id="BROKEN_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HAVEN OF REFUGE</span></h3>

<p>A red dawn was breaking over London; through
the undrawn curtains of the parlour in Lord Rockhurst’s
small house in Whitehall, abutting by the
Holbein gateway, the first rays darted in to mingle
with the dying gleam of a pair of candles that guttered
in their sockets.</p>

<p>Chitterley—my lord’s old confidential servant,
who had shared with him all fortune’s vicissitudes,
through prosperity and peace, through war and exile,
since the last reign—rose from the high-backed
chair upon which he had been dozing, and stretched
his stiffened limbs wearily. Muttering to himself,
as old people will, he fell with sudden alacrity to
replenishing (only just in time, for it was fast
going out) the small cresset which burned at his
hand.</p>

<p>“All good spirits praise the Lord!… Now I
pray no misfortune may have happened this night!…<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Heaven be merciful to us; these be times of
terror!”</p>

<p>He flung a new handful of herbs upon the rekindled
embers, and watched with satisfaction the column
of fragrant smoke that rose circling, now blue, now
white, to hang in clouds under the ceiling. “’Twas
your only remedy against the tainted air,” had said
Dr. Garth; and Dr. Garth was the King’s physician.</p>

<p>“Morning already—and no sign of his lordship!
Had it been a year gone, now, I had got me to my bed,
and ne’er a qualm. But these be no times for frolic—and
e’en if they were, my lord has had little
stomach for it these weeks agone.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, moved to the window, groaning
for the aches in his joints, and peered into the street,
in the hope of catching at last a glimpse of his beloved
master, striding down Whitehall. Dim though
Chitterley’s eyes might be, he would know a furlong
away the swing of the tall figure, the cock of the sword
under the folds of the cloak, the proud tilt of the hat.
But the street was deserted.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the day was rising again over the
stricken city but to make visible its desolation. The
unwholesome mists of the night still stagnated under
the reddening light; there was none of that air of
rejuvenescence, of waking life-cheer, which morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
ought to bring. The stillness was not of repose,
but of hopeless expectancy.</p>

<p>One of those street fires, which were kept burning
at all cross-roads, to combat the pollution, could be
seen in the distance, toward Charing Cross, smouldering
fitfully, unattended, the last thin shafts of tar
smoke rising straight, dismal, through the heavy air.
Somewhere in the palace, behind the banquet hall,
a bell rang the hour—it sounded like a knell for
those that were that day to die. Presently, in this
solitude, a woman’s figure appeared, creeping round
a corner, holding on to the walls, dragging herself
painfully; the only living creature, it seemed, left
besides himself in this vast city. Presently even she
disappeared from the purview.</p>

<p>Chitterley shuddered; and muttering his haunting
“Lord have mercy upon us!” drew back from the
windows to go tease again the reeking herbs in the
cresset, and shift needlessly my lord’s chair.</p>

<p>“Not even a pomander could I persuade him to
take with him…!”</p>

<p>He went over to extinguish the candles and stood
awhile painfully musing.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the outer door. Hardly
trusting his deaf ears, he turned to listen—everything,
anything, was an added terror these days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
terror. The knock was repeated, faintly, then vehemently.</p>

<p>“’Tis not my lord—he hath the house key.
Pray heaven this be no ill news!—Coming, coming!”
he cried shrilly, as yet another summons rang.</p>

<p>Hardly had the door rolled back under his feeble
hands when he found himself thrust on one side:
a woman in low-cut dress, with dishevelled laces hanging
in shreds at her shoulders, brushed past him and
walked tottering into the room beyond, to sink upon
the great chair.</p>

<p>Like an old watch-dog’s, Chitterley’s first thought
was of his duty.</p>

<p>“Madam—madam!” he protested. “His lordship
is not within—” Then, as she turned upon the
querulous sound, and looked vacantly at him, he
staggered back, “God ’a’ mercy; Madam Mantes!”</p>

<p>An ice-cold clutch seemed to be at his heart.
Madame de Mantes it certainly was, the grand
French lady of the Court, whom Lord Rockhurst
had many a time entertained in days (alack, how
far off they seemed!) when people laughed and made
merry; and among the gay she had been the gayest,
among the bright and beautiful the brightest and
most fair. Chitterley could remember how, in this
very room, in that very chair—which they called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the King’s chair, for his Majesty always sat in it
when he visited, as he loved to do, his neighbour,
“my Merry Rockhurst,” for an hour of pleasant converse—she
had sung fit to make his old heart young
again.</p>

<p>Yet, in sooth, this was Madame de Mantes.
Torn and haggard, through the strands of her uncurled
hair, her glazed eyes looked at him from red
and swollen lids, piteously, scarcely as if she could
see. Except for a patch of rouge, her face was livid.</p>

<p>He thought of the figure he had seen crawling along
the walls, and dread was upon him.</p>

<p>“How hot it is—” she complained, in a dry,
whispering voice. “Fires, fires everywhere!—Give
me to drink!”</p>

<p>The man hesitated a moment, upon the blind impulse
of flight. But the long habit of fidelity was
stronger even than fear of the pestilence. He took
up a flask from a table,—the <i lang="fr">en cas</i> after the foreign
manner, awaiting the master’s return,—poured out a
glass of wine and tendered it to her.</p>

<p>“Hot? Eh—but your hand is cold, my lady!”</p>

<p>She drank; seemed to gain a little strength.</p>

<p>“Cold?” she took up the word with an inconsequent
laugh. “So would you be, <i lang="fr">mon ami</i>, had you
been roaming the streets, for months … years …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
as I have been, to-night! You are a kind old man.
The others ran from me … one robbed me and
beat me, then he, too, ran away.…”</p>

<p>And then Chitterley marked how cruelly, in sooth,
the woman had been dealt with; her gown and bodice
rent where seemingly the jewels had been snatched;
and there was blood on her neck, trickling from the
torn lobe of her little ear.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon beau Rockhurst!</i>” she went on, in that loud
whisper, as of one light-headed. “I drink to you, to
you.” She lifted the cup again, but stopped, catching
at her throat: “It is fire—why did you give me
fire to drink?”</p>

<p>He seized the glass from her failing hand.</p>

<p>“God ’a’ mercy! you are raving, madam!—you
must.…”</p>

<p>She turned her red glance to him, then beat the
air with a fierce gesture, imposing silence, and seemed
to strain her ear to sounds inaudible:—</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t laugh, Rockhurst, don’t laugh…!
Oh, if you like not a salt cheek, I can be merry—”</p>

<p>Chitterley had drawn back, step by step, to the
farther end of the room. Then, of a sudden, very
loud and angrily, he spoke:—</p>

<p>“Madam, you are ailing. You are ill. You
must go home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>She came back to her surroundings with a start and
a cry:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu</i>, where am I? Ill? Yes, I am ill!
I am strangling, I can’t breathe!” She clutched at
her throat with both hands, feeling for something
with frantic fingers; then, with a scream that rose
and seemed to circle about the silent room like some
phantom bird: “<i lang="fr">Miséricorde!</i> they are there!…
<i lang="fr">La peste!</i> I have the <i lang="fr">peste</i>.…”</p>

<p>Chitterley’s grey hair bristled on his head.</p>

<p>“A physician!” he cried, and turned to fly.</p>

<p>But, in her delirium, she was quicker than he in
his senile confusedness. She caught him by the
wrist with both her hands, now burning as though,
indeed, she had drunk fire:—</p>

<p>“No! You shall not leave me! I am dying.…
I will not die alone!” The fleeting of madness
returned to her fever-wasted brain: “We are put
in this world with five senses—and ’tis but common
sense to pleasure them. Aye, Rockhurst …
but when it comes to dying!…” Her grip
relaxed; she wrung her hands. “How can such as
we die? Old man, a priest, a priest!”</p>

<p>He felt that he would be less than man if he did
not help her. Priest and physician, she should
have both,—poor soul, poor soul!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>He tried to make her understand him—speaking
loud as to the deaf, in little words as to a child. The
priest, the physician—aye, she should have them—quickly—she
might trust to him. But she
looked at him, uncomprehending, with eyes ever
wilder. A step farther on her awful journey; she
seemed already a world away from her fellow-humans.</p>

<p>Then, as if his meek, aged countenance, all puckered
in distress, were a spectacle of unspeakable horror,
she flung out both arms to ward him from her;
stared round the room like a hunted thing, and, ere
he could call or arrest her, had darted through the
half-open door of the inner room and flung it, clapping,
into the lock between them.</p>

<p>“My lord’s own room!”</p>

<p>Chitterley stood a second helplessly; then came
a groan from within; the sound of a heavy fall.
The old man called upon Heaven and ran on his
errand of mercy.</p>

<p class="tb">The wretched woman found herself in a darkened
room, with heavy curtains closely drawn, illumined
only by a dying night-lamp. She staggered toward
a couch, fought for a moment vainly for breath.
Then strength, and with it, mercifully, consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
gave way; she fell face downward, clutching
the silken hangings.</p>

<p class="tb">It seemed as if it had become suddenly broad day
in that room where Chitterley had kept his night’s
vigil—that room, famed once in Whitehall for
those gatherings of wit and beauty, convened for
his Majesty’s pleasure. A shaft of sunshine, yellow
through the sullen mists, struck the chair where
Charles had been wont to sit; where but a few moments
ago had agonised one whose gay winsomeness
and bird-song he had so often commended.</p>

<p>The vapour of Sir George Garth’s sovereign remedy
rose but in feeble wisp-like exhalations, ever fainter
and wider apart—like to the breath of some dying
thing. Occasionally a sigh, or a groan and a
muffled word or two, came dully from the neighbouring
room. But after a while these ceased; and the
only sound to be heard was that of a blue fly, bloated
and busy, circling about, emphasising the stillness,
to settle ever and anon with a heavy buzz on the wine
which Jeanne de Mantes had spilled from her last
cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="BROKEN_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GOLD WHISTLE</span></h3>

<p>Presently there approached, along the flags of
Whitehall, the sound of steady footfalls. They
mounted the steps and halted before the door; a key
grated in the lock, and Lord Rockhurst led Mistress
Diana Harcourt across the threshold.</p>

<p>She entered without a word, let herself fall in her
turn like one worn out, into the King’s chair, and
lifted her face toward him—a face blanched indeed
with the miseries of the night, its terrors, the long
vigil, the weary wandering, yet full of a brave,
sweet strength.</p>

<p>None of her serenity was reflected on Rockhurst’s
countenance. His face was dark as with an inner
conflict; he averted his eyes as hers sought them.
There was a moment’s heavy silence. He broke it,
at length, standing over the fireless hearth, without
looking at her.</p>

<p>“Now that you are under my roof, Diana, I trust
you will consider yourself as if already—” he hesitated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and then brought out the words harshly, “as
if already in your father’s house.—I fear me,”
he went on, after a pause, “you are dead weary after
our wanderings this night … fruitless search for
shelter—the flaming cross barring us from every
threshold … when it was not mean selfishness
and childish fears that drove us to the street again!—Your
brother fled basely.…”</p>

<p>She interrupted, wincing under the bitterness of his
accents.</p>

<p>“Ah, poor Ned,” she pleaded; “he is but a boy.
And his wits are never of the strongest.… In
his way, he loves me. And, truly, I am glad he has
escaped.”</p>

<p>“You have a strong heart, child!”</p>

<p>Though the words were kind, voice and look were
hard. She shivered and drooped her head.</p>

<p>“You are cold,” he went on, with a sudden softening
in his tone. “Indeed, ’tis the chill hour of the
day.” He glanced hastily round the room, and
catching sight of the spilt wine and the soiled cup,
frowned, then laughed contemptuously. “So—even
old Chitterley hath forgot his duty! These, in
sooth, are days of test. I will rouse him, and you
shall have fire and refreshment.”</p>

<p>She heard his tread on the stairs, the opening and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
shutting of doors within the house. Quickly he
came back to her.</p>

<p>“Aye, even my old Chitterley gone! …” he
cried, with a bitter twist of the lip. “Neither
brotherly love, nor life-long service and companionship.…
Nay, what should still hold, these
times, when no man knows the hour when his life
will be withdrawn? Oh, are you human—you,
Diana, who sit so still and have no woman’s
plaint?”</p>

<p>His voice broke with sudden passion. She raised
her eyes and strove to smile; but the shudder of
fatigue seized her.</p>

<p>Without another word he lifted the cresset of charcoal
from its stand, blew upon the expiring glow,
cast fresh fuel upon it; then, the flame once more
enkindled, flung the whole on the hearth. She
watched him, and gave a little feminine cry of protest
as he next seized the first thing at hand, a couple of
books, and tore them up ruthlessly to feed the fire.</p>

<p>“O, my lord!” she began, as the flame roared up
the chimney. But the faint laugh died on her lips
when she met his glance.</p>

<p>“I must leave you,” he said, when he had thrown
in a couple of logs. “I must leave you; it will go
ill indeed, if, within the hour, I return not with coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and horses. If I have to plead King’s Service, I
shall carry you out of the infection.”</p>

<p class="tb">The door closed on him. Left alone, Diana sighed
deeply. All the bright look of courage faded from
her face. How harshly he had spoken! how coldly
he had looked upon her—when not averting his
eyes as from something troubling!…</p>

<p>Diana Harcourt, widow of twenty, bound by a
freak of fate, through the merest impulse of womanly
pity, to Rockhurst’s young son,—so faithful a lover,
so gallant a youth,—knew her heart given to Rockhurst
himself! What shame—what treachery!
Moments were when she thought to guess her hidden
love as returned; and then she felt herself strong and
proud, and took a kind of high spiritual glory in the
thought of how true they both would remain to honour
and plighted troth. “Loved he not honour
more,” as the chivalrous song had it, she would
have none of his love.… But, to feel it in this
sacred silence, in this noble self-denial, that was a
kind of pain more exquisite than any joy she had
ever known.</p>

<p>Yet moments were, again, such as this, when his
formal manner, the sombreness of his gaze, smote her
with distressing conjecture. Was his solicitude but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
for his boy’s sake, after all? Was the self-betrayal—sweet
and terrible—that had so often seemed to
hover on his lips, but the gallantry of the high-bred
courtier? Or—worse suspicion yet!—had
he read her folly, and was it but compassion that
spoke in his lingering gaze?</p>

<p>As she sat staring dully into the fire he had kindled
for her, vividly the troubled scenes of this night of
catastrophe rose before her.</p>

<p class="tb">Her grandmother’s great card-room, lit and decked
as usual; the dwindled company, each with the
heavy knowledge of the peril without and about
stamped upon his countenance, each with his hypocrite
smile for my Lady Chillingburgh, who glared
upon them from out her chair, and forbade the pestilence
to exist, since she would have none of it.…</p>

<p>Next, the fair French lady from the Court courtesying
in her waves of amber satin, and fixing her,
Diana,—aye, and the Lord Constable, too,—with
such singular eyes. She recalled to mind,
truly, how those fierce eyes had followed Rockhurst,
and how Cousin Lionel had smiled as he watched.…
Tush, the poor creature knew not what she
was doing—was she not stricken ill and in fever?—She
might well have mad eyes.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Lionel who had brought her. Lady Chillingburgh’s
own grandson who had given the citadel
to the enemy it had so long defied! In rapid succession
the horrid events reënacted themselves in
Diana’s brain:—</p>

<p>She heard her brother screaming on the stairs,
saw him break in upon them, a foolish country lad,
frenzied in his panic.</p>

<p>She saw the frightened faces of their guests, and
Lionel’s ever-mocking smile—“Sheer poltroonery!”—he
was saying. And ever and again she sought
and found the comfort of Rockhurst’s strong protective
glance.</p>

<p>And then came the end.… The huddled
figure in the great chair. The face of her that had
had so stout a heart, conquered in death—but less
piteous, less awful sight than the living face of the
French madam. “<i>The plague is there</i>—” She
heard Lionel’s cry of warning, and then all is black
about her.</p>

<p>And now she relived the moment when she had
awakened from her swoon; darkness and silence
all about her. She thought that the nightmare of
the card-room had given way to some exquisite dream.…
Rockhurst’s arm was supporting her, her head
rested on his shoulder, and the solitude of a sombre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
night held them safe. Above their heads, outstretched
tree branches swayed murmurously as the
breeze stirred. She heard his heart-beats beneath
her ear, and an unknown joy ran like music in her
veins: life, reality, seemed thrust as far away from
her as yonder flickering lights in the black distance.
It seemed indeed a dream, and surely one may accept
happiness in a dream! Sighing, she had yielded
herself to it one moment—one moment—alas,
even as she stirred, lo, it was hers no longer! Beneath
her hands was fine turf, in her nostrils the scent
of fading roses; she knew where she was—somewhere
under the beeches of Chillingburgh House
gardens. She remembered, she understood. He
had snatched her, unconscious, from the danger of
the infected house. And as she moved, his clasp
relaxed; he spoke to her, coldly enough, she
thought:—</p>

<p>“You are better? It is well.”</p>

<p class="caption">The huddled figure in the great chair. The face of her that had

sight than the living face of the French madam.</p>
</div>

<p class="tb">… Then had begun their strange pilgrimage
through the London streets, the long, long night.
She went beside him, through the tangle of unknown,
unlit ways; seeing him only ever and anon, painted
as it were against the darkness by the glare of the
smoky street fires in the more open spaces. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
white hand, the sword drawn, guarding her from the
prowling thieves of the night. Inhuman wretches,
to whom the stricken city’s extremity was fortune’s
boon, slinking after them like pariah dogs…!
They had spoken little: mostly words of bare need.
But once he had told her she was brave; and once
that she was strong indeed.… She had at one
moment noticed a great pity in his eyes.—Ah, he
need never have pitied her; she had been happy,
being with him.</p>

<p class="tb">She started from her heavy revery: some one was
knocking at the casement.</p>

<p>Outside the window the lines of a man’s head and
shoulders, a man hatless, with disordered periwig,
were silhouetted blackly against the morning light.
She sprang to her feet, terror stifling the scream
in her throat. She remembered the marauders that
had slunk after them in the night, more to be dreaded
these desperate days than pestilence itself. But it
was her own name that met her ear, urgently cried:—</p>

<p>“Diana, open!—’Tis I, Lionel.”</p>

<p>Before the words had penetrated to sense, she had
recognised the voice. Upon the impulse of her relief,
she hastened to the window and flung the casement
apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cousin Lionel…!”</p>

<p>But this was a Cousin Lionel she had never before
known. About his livid face the dank curls hung
in wild dishevelment—he, whose person had ever
seemed as sedately ordered as his mind. He motioned
her from him so fiercely that she fell back in
fresh alarm.</p>

<p>“Aye, Diana,” said he, answering her look, “you
may well be afraid—’tis like enough I have it!
And were it not that I am here to save you from
worse than plague, for the sheer love I bear you, there
should be leagues between us—Stand where you
are, Diana! Come not a step nearer!”</p>

<p>He drew himself with effort up to the window-sill,
from some ledge whereon he had climbed; then,
seated, he looked in upon her again; and to his
pallid countenance came a ghostly semblance of the
old sarcastic smile:—</p>

<p>“Never enquire how I tracked you. I knew
that the Rakehell, who chivalrously took you from
the charge of your own kin—to rescue you from
the plague, forsooth!—would find no shelter for
you but that of his own honourable habitation!”</p>

<p>“Lionel…!”</p>

<p>Sudden anger drove all fear from her. He went
on:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“You would have been safer at Chillingburgh
House, once the stricken Frenchwoman gone. And
so my lord knew as well as I. Our grand dame never
died of the sickness, child, but of a fit of anger—and
not before her time, either! But let that pass.
I saw thee on the Strand, Diana, a while ago—marked
thee hither and knew the trick played on
thee. A-tramp the whole night, till your body and
your spirit be worn out. Is’t not so? And my lord
… so tender, so protecting, so fatherly. Is’t not
so?”</p>

<p>“Lionel…!”</p>

<p>The man changed his tone:—</p>

<p>“Diana, ’tis but a few hundred paces to her Majesty’s
House of the Blue Nuns, in St. Martin’s Lane,
where our kinswoman, Madam Anastasia, would
shelter you in honour and safety. Come forth now,
from this place; ’tis worse, I tell you, than the
Pest-house! I will go before thee; I can yet
protect thee along the street, if I may not approach
thee.…”</p>

<p>Never had Diana heard that ring of passion from
his lips; even when he had pleaded for her love,
there had always run an undercurrent of mockery
and cynicism in the tenderest word. Truly, these
days changed all men’s nature. But Diana was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
swayed: she was afire at the odiousness of the
slander cast on him she loved.</p>

<p>“I thank you, cousin,” she returned coldly. “But
I have placed myself under Lord Rockhurst’s protection;
and since you have been pleased to watch
me, sir, you will have seen the Lord Constable leave
this house but a few moments ago. It was in search
of a coach, and it is his purpose to escort me out of
the town, even this day, to my own home.”</p>

<p>The man on the window-sill gave a fierce laugh.</p>

<p>“Art as simple, Diana, as thou wouldst fain
make out? Dost really believe thy protector—’tis
a fine name, in sooth—will find thee that coach?”</p>

<p>“Not a word more!” broke in the other. She
had as strong a spirit as his own. “Who should
know Lord Rockhurst better than I? Ah, who has
better reason to know him? If all the world were
to believe evil of him, yet would I still trust him
with my life.”</p>

<p>“And is there naught you value more than life?”</p>

<p>“How dare you, cousin!”</p>

<p>“Is your good name nothing to you?” he insisted.</p>

<p>“How dare you!” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Nay, Diana, listen to me!—Shall I tell thee
what’s to happen? The Rakehell will return to thee
in a little while, dejected, aye, heart-broken! Far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and wide, not a horse, not a coach, not a driver to be
had for love or money. He has bargained, pleaded,
threatened, in vain. So thou must even trust thyself
to him further—to him who is as thy father.…”</p>

<p>Diana started, bit her lip. The words struck her;
and vehemently she thrust them from her.</p>

<p>“Then, Diana,” went on Ratcliffe, ever more cuttingly,
“will he discover something strange in the
character of his protective feelings.… Thou, too,
will read in thine own … filial … heart. Behold,
the end is not difficult to guess!”</p>

<p>“Oh, foul-mouthed!” cried the young widow,
recoiling.</p>

<p>Indignation and terror mixed were in her voice.
To have the veil thus torn by sacrilegious hands
from the innermost shrine; the sanctuary of her
tender secret thus broken!… Ratcliffe clutched
the window-frame with both hands and thrust his
face into the room, his features working again with
that unwonted passion:—</p>

<p>“Diana—ah, Diana, for heaven’s sake, you must
understand! These days, it seems, all barriers are
broken down, all laws violated with impunity.
And even now, even you, Diana, will surely pay the
price, if you accept the protection of Rakehell Rockhurst!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Diana swept a gesture of final scorn:—</p>

<p>“Begone, Lionel! Away with you as you came!
I pity you … thief of men and women’s good
report. Alas! cousin, do I not know what purpose
you have in this slander? Shame that these days of
terror should wake you to no worthier mind!”</p>

<p>The man fixed her, a breathing space or two,
without speaking. Had she been less incensed, she
might have noted something in his look singularly
belying the thoughts she imputed to him—might
have seen a purpose as earnest as it was selfless.</p>

<p>“One word, then, and I go—Di, from the days
when we were children together, I have loved thee.
Dost remember how I called thee my little wife?
You’ll have none of my warning now—so be it!
In a little while you’ll want me, you’ll call on me.
I shall be near, I shall hear thee.—Stay; here is
the gold whistle you once gave me—that Easter—years
ago! You have, of course, forgotten it. I
have kept it close, you see.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a second, poising the bauble at the
end of its long ribbon, frowning. Then he cast it
into the room.</p>

<p>“Risk for risk—all is risk!… My lips
have not touched it since the pestilence came so nigh
them. Di, hark to me, Di. When you want my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
help this day, you have but to whistle, I’ll hear and
help.… I go. Yet not so far but what I can
guard my own.”</p>

<p>She stood, her head averted; her foot beating the
floor, image of scornful defiance. He slipped down
from his perch to the ledge and poised himself yet
a second, looking in on her as when he had first
appeared:—</p>

<p>“Thou, in the Rakehell’s hands—and the world
gone mad around thee…! Ah, shall’t whistle
sooner than thou thinkest!”</p>

<p>She wheeled to silence him; he was gone. A
bitter conflict rose in her mind as she stood staring
at the blank window space. In spite of herself, the
memory of his look, of the deep earnestness of his
voice, began to shake her sense of security.… He
thought he had the sickness, yet he came to warn her!…
Another man would have had little reck of
aught but himself, with that shadow of doom spread
over him.… Yet he hated Rockhurst—oh,
how he hated him!—and had he not all but killed
Rockhurst’s son for aspiring to her?… With the
perspicacity of his relentless love for her, he had read
her secret. Reason enough, then, that he should
strive to poison her mind against one whom she
knew so noble.… Yet again, unscrupulous, daring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
cruel even in his very love for her, Ratcliffe
had taken piteous pains to guard her against himself.
Now, he was lurking in the lanes below, for
her sake, instead of hying him to the nearest physician,
so urgent did he believe her danger.… Was
there, could there be danger?</p>

<p>Her ear caught the sound of the key in the lock;
she knew it was Rockhurst returning. On a sudden
impulse she picked up the whistle and thrust it into
her bodice. Her heart beat to suffocation as she
heard his hand on the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="BROKEN_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">NEMESIS</span></h3>

<p>Rockhurst came in slowly and stood a moment,
contemplating Diana before he spoke. The bronze
of his face was singularly blanched; his grave eye
was alight with a threatening of fire. Then he spoke,
quickly:—</p>

<p>“I have beaten the neighbourhood. Whitehall
is as a desert, the name of the King itself an empty
sound. The whole town is fled, dying or dead.”
He took her hand, clasping it with a pressure so fierce
as almost to draw a cry from her. “For love or
money, it is impossible to obtain horse, coach, or
man.”</p>

<p>Her fluttering heart slowed down to the dull beat
of misery; she sought to draw her hand from his.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord!”</p>

<p>Unheeding, he went on:—</p>

<p>“Pestilence is rushing onward like a flood—There
is no rock, no hilltop, that is not fated to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
swallowed up in time. Diana, we are as those
doomed by the Deluge, who have taken refuge on
the mountain only to watch the deadly waters rise
and count the hours left to them!”</p>

<p>He broke off; she had wrenched her hands from
his grasp and had shrunk away from him, covering
her face. Not the dreadful import of his words
frightened her, but the fire of his glance, the mad
exultation of the voice that thus pronounced their
doom.</p>

<p>“What,” he exclaimed, his tones vibrating to a
tenderness more terrible still to her ears, “have I
scared thee?—Brave heart, afraid at last?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—I am afraid,” she murmured behind
her clasped fingers. But, even as she spoke, her
strong nature reacted against the folly of weakness.
She dropped her hands, drew herself proudly up and
turned, looking him steadily in the eyes:—</p>

<p>“No, my lord, ’twas but an evil thought!”</p>

<p>He returned her gaze fixedly, and she saw how
the blood began to rise, slow, dark, in his cheek.</p>

<p>“Yet, why should I say we are doomed?” he
went on, under his breath. “Why should not this
house be as the ark of refuge? Diana,”—the dreadful
joy broke out again in eye and accent,—“have
you understood how it stands with us? There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
no help for it; we are shut in together. Heaven
itself has sealed the way that would divide us—”</p>

<p class="tb">So, it had come! That moment she had dreamt
of, with a fierce abandonment to his ecstasy; that
moment, the very thought of which she had prayed
against with tears, as if the mere passage of its forbidden
sweetness through her heart were a sin!
It had come, in this bitterness, this shame, this
shattering of the ideal she held so high! She moved
from him without a word, let herself drop mechanically
into the King’s chair, and sat, her hands clasping
the carven arms, staring straight before her.
Rockhurst fell on his knees beside her.</p>

<p>“Diana, Diana—I love you!—And ah, Diana,
you love me—”</p>

<p>She flung out her hands to push him from her,
and all her wounded heart spoke in her cry:—</p>

<p>“Do not say it, my lord! Oh, I have so dreaded
to hear you say it!”</p>

<p>But her very pain was triumph in his ears. As
masterfully as he caught and imprisoned her hands
once again, so did his passion seize and crush her
woman’s scruples:—</p>

<p>“We are alone in a dying world! Who knows
if we shall see another dawn! Shall we not take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
day that is given us, make use of life while life is still
ours?”</p>

<p>And while she looked at him, speechless, her eyes
dark in the sorrowful pallor of her face, he cried in a
tone that pierced to her very marrow:—</p>

<p>“Diana—come to my arms and teach me, let
me teach thee, how sweet life can be … how
sweet death can be!”</p>

<p>She had ceased to struggle against him. Her hands
lay inert in his.</p>

<p>He put his arm about her then; and, motionless,
she submitted. But the tears slowly, slowly welled
to her piteous eyes. Then he drew back from her,
rose and stood again, gazing at her; the exultation,
the fires of ecstasy, fading from his face, and something
hard, ruthless, taking their place.</p>

<p>“I can get a priest to wed us, in Whitehall, ere the
day be an hour older,” he said, frowning upon her.</p>

<p>Through the tears she would not shed, her great
eyes dilated upon him.</p>

<p>“And what will you say—what shall we say—to
your son, my lord?”</p>

<p>Rockhurst started as if he had been struck. A
masterful man, who all his life had dominated others,
he bent his brows with a terrible resentment on her
who dared thwart him at this supreme hour of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
will; dared lift against him the one weapon that could
pierce his armour.</p>

<p>“You took the trust, my lord, even as I yielded my
troth.…”</p>

<p>His anger broke forth, the more ruthlessly that he
was, for the first time in his life, perhaps, abandoning
himself to an unworthy part, a part of weakness.
Broken phrases escaped his lips, contradictions lost
in the irresistible logic of passion.</p>

<p>“My son, … my son?—I shall answer for myself
to my son.—Nay, what account have I to render
to my son! A beardless boy, shall he come between
us?… Diana, your eyes have lied a thousand
times, or you love me!… That promise to Harry
was no promise, wrested from you, from me, because
of a white face, pleading, because of a red wound!
And, if he be true flesh of mine, he will have none
of you, your heart being another’s.—Why, my dear,”—his
voice changed,—“think you Harry will ever
have his bride, will ever see his father again?”</p>

<p>So long as his eye flamed, as his voice harshly
chid her, she felt strong. But against that note of
tenderness she weakened. A sense of physical failing
came over her; she thought of the moment when,
in the darkness of the garden, she had awakened to
find herself in his arms.… Perhaps, in truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
death was very near to them. To slip from the
moorings of life, on the tide of his great love—ah,
he had said it; it would be sweet! She clasped her
hands to her breast; but at the touch of Lionel’s
gold bauble, something in herself that Rockhurst’s
words had lulled, started into vivid life again; something
that would not let her accept the easier course.
If death were, even at this moment, gloating upon
them, the better reason to look on it with loyal eyes.
Were Harry indeed fated never to meet bride or
father again, then must father and bride remain
sacred in noble memory! And not because she and
Rockhurst were so fain to break it, was a promise
less binding a promise. One sentence of Lionel’s
rang in her ear: “Behold, the end is not difficult to
guess”—and with it the echo of her own voice crying
back to him, “Oh, foul-mouthed!”</p>

<p>Quickly she made her choice; and, brave in her
pain, had a smile as she turned to speak.</p>

<p>“Once, my lord, you saved me, when I scarce
knew myself in danger. To-day it is given to me to
pay my debt. And I save you. Give me your arm
again, kind, beloved friend, and through the hot contamination
of these streets, as once through the pure
snow, bring me to honourable shelter.”</p>

<p>For a second, the unexpected check, the unlooked-for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
strength of her resistance, kept him silent. Then
gently, as if to an unreasonable child:—</p>

<p>“And to what shelter? Poor Diana!”</p>

<p>Her smile took something of the divine, maternal
pity which lurks in every good woman’s heart for
the man she loves.</p>

<p>“But a stone’s throw from this place, my dear
lord,—her Majesty’s House of the Blue Nuns will
not refuse to open its doors to me,—as, indeed, I
should have minded me sooner.”</p>

<p>She rose, and moved steadily toward the door,
striving to seem as though she had no fear of his
arresting her. But before she had time to raise
the latch, his clasp of iron was on her wrist.</p>

<p>A cry rising from the street drove them apart like
a sword:—</p>

<p>“Father—father!”</p>

<p>They looked at each other with starting eyes,
blanched cheeks. Then the cry rose again:—</p>

<p>“My lord,—my Lord Rockhurst!—father, are
you within?”</p>

<p>The colour rushed back to Diana’s face; a flame
of joy leaped to her eye.</p>

<p>“This is no spirit-call, but good human sound.
Harry, honest Harry here!—Ah, my lord, in time
to save us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The revulsion of feeling, the unconscious admission
of her words, a fierce flame of insane jealousy,
suddenly kindled by the glad note in her voice,
broke down the last shred of Rockhurst’s self-control.
His passion escaped him, tigerish:—</p>

<p>“By the Lord God of Heaven or the Devil Lord of
Hell, thou shalt not go to him!”</p>

<p>The young voice was uplifted again without.</p>

<p>“Knock once more, Robin; I hear stirring
within.”</p>

<p>And a lusty shout succeeded:—</p>

<p>“Ho, Chitterley, ’tis I, Robin, with Master Harry
Rockhurst!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst caught Diana in his arms.</p>

<p>“Mine, Diana, mine, and none shall come between
us!”</p>

<p>He held her for a second against his breast, and
she heard the great hammering of his heart; then
she found herself thrust within a darkened room,
heard the door close upon her, the shooting of a bolt.
A prisoner—and darkness all about her, a strange
suffocating darkness, thick with the fumes of a burnt-out
lamp.</p>

<p class="tb">As the Lord Constable unbolted the outer door,
he was met by the precipitate entrance of his son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good heavens, Chitterley—” The broken
words were cut short: “My lord … yourself in
person! Thank God, thank God!”</p>

<p>Young Rockhurst cast himself impetuously upon
his father’s breast, sobbing with excitement. The
latter suffered the embrace in silence, supported the
boy, as he clung to him in sudden weakness, into the
room, led him to a chair. Then he stood a second
in gloomy silence, staring at the young bowed figure,
sitting where she had sat, his face hidden in his
hands, even as hers had been. Tears! and this
weakling would wed Diana!—Diana, who had not
suffered hers to fall! Yet Rockhurst loved his son;
and there was a strange rending pain at his heart.</p>

<p>Into the oppressive stillness, broken only by
Harry’s catching breath, there came from the inner
room a stir as of curtains wrenched apart, as of
creaking easements thrust open; and next a stifled
cry. Rockhurst, expecting the instant of revelation,
braced himself as a man may for the meeting of his
death-stroke. But nothing more was heard, save
a long, sweet whistle—some call in the street,
doubtless. Ah—Diana would not betray him!—Diana
loved him! As if the shrill, sweet
signal had roused him, Harry Rockhurst started,
dashed the tears from his cheeks, and rising, seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
his father’s hand to pour forth a torrent of
words:—</p>

<p>“Alas, my lord, and how had you the heart to leave
me in this ignorance of your peril?—Had not Lionel
writ to me—Oh, father, never look so sternly on
me! I know I have transgressed your command
to remain in the country, but how could I keep away?
’Twas not in nature—Where is Diana? Oh,
my God, Chillingburgh House is deserted, the doors
open to the winds, the old lady abandoned, dead,
stark in her chair! Where is Diana? Father—my
Diana!”</p>

<p>His voice rose to a scream, as his father turned a
terrible, set face upon him; his father, from whom
he had scarce ever known but loving and joyful looks.
Evil beyond words must be the tidings awaiting him.
He clutched his breast with both hands.</p>

<p>“Harry, be a man!” cried Rockhurst, starting as
he marked the livid change that spread over the young
countenance. But he was too late.</p>

<p>“Dead?” cried the lad, and on a sudden gasped
for breath. “A curse on this wound that will
not heal.”</p>

<p>He tore at the lapels of his riding-coat, reeled and
fell, barely caught, into his father’s arms.</p>

<p>“My God—I have killed my son!” Blood welled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
out between Rockhurst’s fingers, as he clasped the
slight, inert form.</p>

<p>“Harry!” he cried frantically to the deaf ears,
“Harry, no, she is not dead. She is not dead! You
shall even see her!—Hither, Diana!”</p>

<p>He raised a loud call for her; then, with a groan,
remembered him—the shot bolt! Had ever a
man been so mad, had ever a man been so base—been
so punished? He lowered the body to the
ground; ’twas the old wound indeed, that wound
taken in the defence of his father’s honour. A light
word had been spoken of him to his son—his poor
country lad, who had never heard, had never known,
of one in the town nicknamed the Rakehell!</p>

<p>Again he raised a desperate cry for help:—</p>

<p>“Robin, there without…!”</p>

<p>And all at once the silent, abandoned house was
full of voices and footsteps—here were the white
face of his own old servant; the scared chubbiness
of Yorkshire Robin—and another countenance,
unknown and solemn. And behold, Chitterley was
saying:—</p>

<p>“This way, good doctor!”</p>

<p>When the moment holds life and death in the
balance, there is no room for surprise.</p>

<p>“Chitterley, ha, Chitterley,” cried Rockhurst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
“Water and bandages, in Heaven’s name! This
way, Sir Physician!—A physician by Divine
mercy!”</p>

<p>The man of healing, who had been much occupied
with his pomander, dropped it from his nostrils
to stare on the unexpected scene. And Chitterley,
whose dim eyes had only just become aware of his
master, burst into a dismal wail:—</p>

<p>“My lord, fly!—Here is plague, here is death!”
Then, in yet more piercing lamentation: “What!
Master Harry, too! Merciful Heaven!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Rockhurst to the physician, “your
attention hither!”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said the doctor, “this seems an urgent
case.”</p>

<p>He was perhaps not displeased to find, instead of
the plague-stricken patient he had been summoned
to attend, a clean lad a-bleeding of a sword wound.
Old Chitterley ran feebly hither and thither, as father
and surgeon bent together over the unconscious
form. Robin stared, voiceless.</p>

<p>“It is an old wound, ill-healed,” explained Rockhurst.
“My faithful son—he fought, a month
agone, one who impugned my good name—now,
hearing I was in danger of the sickness, naught could
keep him from me. All the way from Yorkshire …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and he wasted with the fever of the hurt! When
I saw him I chid him.” The father looked with
dry eyes of agony at the physician’s thoughtful
face.</p>

<p>“The bleeding has somewhat waned,” said the
latter, then, without committing himself. Then, rising
stiffly from his knees: “I could attend to the
young gentleman better,” he pursued, “were he upon
a couch. May I assist your lordship—?”</p>

<p>He had recognised the noble Lord Constable, the
King’s friend, and was full of solicitude.</p>

<p>“Nay—I need no aid!” The father gathered his
boy again into his arms. “Chitterley, unbolt the
door—How now!” The old man had flung himself
before his master and, with clasped hands, was
motioning him desperately back. “The wretch
has gone crazy!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear master, in God’s name, she lies
there!”</p>

<p>“She?”</p>

<p>For one mad instant Rockhurst deemed his ancient
servant stood at bay before his own threatened
honour. Almost he laughed in scornful anger.
What recked he now of aught except this bleeding
burden on his breast? Aye, and if those purple lids,
sealed in such death-like peace, were to unclose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Harry were to behold Diana, the father knew—and
was pierced as by a two-edged sword of ruth and
tenderness at the thought—that yet his son would
never doubt him. Chitterley was still speaking.
The tale of retribution was not complete:—</p>

<p>“The French lady, your lordship, sick of the
plague! She lies within, dying of the sickness.
’Twas for her I sought Mr. Burbage.…”</p>

<p>Rockhurst staggered, as one struck from an unexpected
quarter. In haste the physician advanced,
but just in time to seize the limp body from the
father’s relaxing grasp. Here were strange events,
enough to bewilder the ordinary, decorous man of
science on his professional round! But, as times
went, astonishment had no part in men’s lives.
Catastrophe had ceased to shock. The Lord Constable
and his servant, either or both, might be mad:
few people were quite sane these days, but here was
a young life hanging on a thread: enough for the
moment, if skill of his could strengthen its hold.
As for the creature with the plague yonder,—whoever
she might be,—let her rot: ’twas only one added
to the ten thousand bound to die that day! He laid
the lad all his length on the floor, drew a phial of
cordial from his breast, and set dazed Robin to bring
him the water from the table; while Rockhurst stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
staring at Chitterley, his face more stricken than
that pallid one at his feet.</p>

<p>The old servant, on his side, still stretched out
trembling arms in barrier; it seemed as if his mind
had stopped on that effort of desperate warning. At
last, tonelessly, Rockhurst spoke:—</p>

<p>“In my room—?”</p>

<p>“Aye, my lord. She was dying; I could not keep
her out!”</p>

<p>“Sick of the plague, said you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, your lordship.”</p>

<p>The father gave a terrible cry:—</p>

<p>“O God, Thy vengeance is greater than my sin—Diana!”</p>

<p>He looked down at the physician, absorbed in ineffectual
efforts to recall the wandering spirit to its
fair young body; and in a voice that smote even that
ear, so fully seasoned to sorrow’s plaint:—</p>

<p>“Sir—so has Heaven dealt with me this day, that
if I must needs hear now that he is dead—my only
son … ’twould be the best tidings … in very
truth!”</p>

<h2>THE RED DESOLATION</h2>

<h3 id="RED_I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WATCHERS</span></h3>

<p>“I have seen many terrible sights in my life, Master
Chitterley,—none so terrible as this.”</p>

<p>Thus old Martin Bracy, Sergeant-Yeoman of the
Tower of London, to the Lord Constable’s body-servant.</p>

<p>His companion flung up trembling hands for all
response. As old as the sergeant—whose head
had grown white in the King’s service: at home in the
civil wars, abroad in Charles’s regiment of Flanders—but
of less solid metal, years had stricken him
harder, and he had little breath to spare after his
grievous ascent to the platform of the Beauchamp
Tower. And as the two now stood, side by side,
looking down from the great height over the stricken
city, they might have served as types, one of green old
age, the other of wintry senility.</p>

<p class="tb">The scene outspread below them was indeed such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
as to strike awe to the stoutest heart. It was the
fifth of September, third day of the great fire;
and nothing, it seemed, was like to arrest the spread
of the red desolation until it had embraced the whole
of the town.</p>

<p>Under the canopy of black smoke, like some monster
of nightmare, the fire crouched, spread, uncoiled
itself; now it clapped ragged wings of flame high into
the sky, now grasped new, unexpected quarters as
with a stealthily outreached claw. The wind ran
lightly from the east, so that, in cruel contrast, the
sky was fair blue over their heads, while to the westward
horizon it spread ensanguined, overhung with
lurid clouds.</p>

<p class="tb">“If hell itself had broken open,” said Martin
Bracy, “and were vomiting yonder, methinks it
would scarce show us a more affrighting picture.
Often these days, Master Chitterley, I have taken to
minding me again of the Crop-Heads’ sayings—and
I had a surfeit of them in my days of imprisonment,
forever talking of Judgment! Aye, I would have
my laugh at them, then. But now it comes back to
me:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<em>First the scourge of Plague; and thereafter</em> (that is now)
<em>the scourge of Fire</em>!’”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>He mused as the aged will, speaking his thought
aloud:—</p>

<p>“There was one Jedediah Groggins—Smite-Them-Hip-and-Thigh
was the name he gave himself,
but Smit’em-Grogs they used to call him (aye,
and a smiter he was!)—who had charge of the
jail at York, where I was caged awhile, ye wot, after
Marston Moor—”</p>

<p>Chitterley nodded his palsied head; his faded eyes
looked out with scarce a flicker of comprehension on
the present vision that so impressed the soldier; but
his brain was still to be stirred by memories of the
past.</p>

<p>“Marston Moor … aye! ’Twas at Marston
my Lord Rockhurst took the pike-push in his thigh—and
he and I in hiding long days after in a burnt-out
farm-house on the wolds. Scarce bite or sup had
I for him. And he fretting for the death of his gallant
friend, Sir Paul Farrant, killed at his side—Aye,
aye, good Sir Paul—”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s gaze was still roaming out to where
the great heart of the city throbbed in agony.</p>

<p>“‘<em>There went up a smoke in his wrath and a fire
flamed forth from his face</em>,’” he went on. “Truly, I
mind me, that was one of this Jedediah’s favourite
texts. Yes—I had my laugh at it then: little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
thought I should ever see it come true, as I have
done these days!… I was young then, and made
mock of such things. But, sure, the sins of this
land began with the Crop-Heads themselves, when
they took up arms against his sacred Majesty.” He
raised his hand to his velvet cap. “But they were
right in this, friend Chitterley: the wrath of the Lord
is an awful thing.—Hark ye at that!”</p>

<p>A dull explosion had rent the air. A belching
column of white smoke, fringed with black, sprang up
at the extremity of the fiery picture. The sergeant
moved to the corner of the parapet to peer forth:—</p>

<p>“See yonder … our lads at work! Blowing up
houses ahead of the fire. Aye, truly, Master Chitterley,
I would his lordship had let me take the mining
party to-day. But one would think—in all respect—there
was a very devil in him, since this outbreak
began. ’Tis ever to the hottest with him. And the
men must after him, though the flames be as greedy as
hell’s.—’Tis hard on a soldier,” added the old campaigner,
with a philosophic sigh, “to be driven to burn
before his time!”</p>

<p>The other’s clouded perception caught but the
hint of danger to a beloved master.</p>

<p>“His lordship?” he cried; “and whither went he
to-day, Sergeant?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Toward Bishopsgate. See, where I point;
there, where ’tis like looking upon a pit of fire.”</p>

<p>Chitterley curved his withered hands over his eyes
and strove to fix them in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“God save him,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Amen,” echoed Bracy earnestly, “for he carries
those white hairs of his whither he would scarce have
ventured his raven locks! ’Tis beyond all reason.
Aye, and Master Harry with him.… Lord, Lord,
how it doth burn!”</p>

<p>Bracy seated himself upon the sill of an embrasure,
and drawing a stump of pipe from his pocket, proceeded
to strike flint and kindle the <i lang="fr">tabaco</i>, with all
the old soldier’s habit of making the most of a spare
hour of rest. The other remained standing; forlorn,
pathetic figure enough, beaten about by the
light wind that flapped the skirts of his coat against
the wasted limbs, and set sparse strands of white hair
dancing as in mockery about his skull.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bracy rolled another text upon his tongue
as two or three fresh explosions, closely following each
other, shocked even the mighty masonry of the
Tower:—</p>

<p>“‘<em>The earth shook and trembled, because He was
angry with them.</em>’ Aye, ’twould seem to fit in singularly!—Yet,
as you and I know, ’tis but our men at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
work of salvage. They must even destroy to save!—There
went the last house in Shoreditch!” He made
a gesture with his pipe-stem. “Ha, now the Hall
falls upon itself like a house of cards!… Pray
Heaven none of our boys be caught beneath the dropping
masonry, as was honest Corporal Tulip yester-eve!
’Tis no marvel to me, Master Chitterley,” he
went on, settling himself more comfortably on his
narrow seat, “that the men like not the work. Nay,
were it with other than my Lord Constable, or young
Harry—or one such as I am, Master Chitterley—we
might well expect a show of rebellion among them.
To see death, you may say, be soldier’s life,—aye, give
death, lay siege, waste, burn and slay,—all in the
way of glorious war, friend Chitterley, and service of
King—wholesome heat of blood to keep the horrors
off—But this business, there is neither glory nor
plunder in it. No—no, I’ve seen sour looks and
lagging feet, as much as dare be, at least, under my
lord’s eye or Master Harry’s.”</p>

<p>“My lord—Master Harry—” repeated Chitterley,
as in a kind of dream. “Do not mock me,
sergeant, but there be days now when I scarce know
them apart … remembering.… Or rather—”</p>

<p>“Aye,” interrupted the soldier, good-humoured,
yet impatient of the other’s maundering, “I catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
your meaning. Young Master Harry that was a boy
has grown marvellous quick a man these troublous
times. ’Tis his gallant father all over again as you
and I knew him. And, on the other hand, my Lord
Constable is changed—oh, damnably changed!
An old man in one year!—Hark in your ear! ’Tis
never plague horrors, nor fire horrors, that have
worked on him so sorely; ’tis the mind, Master
Chitterley. Trouble of the mind!”</p>

<p>He tapped his forehead with the pipe-stem, nodded
his head, and thereafter puffed awhile in sagacious
meditation.</p>

<p>“In faith,” said Chitterley, with piteous trembling
of the lip, “my dear lord’s hair has grown as white
as mine own.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is trouble changes a man,” pursued the
sergeant, presently. He cast a look of kindly pity at
Chitterley. “And in sooth, poor soul,” muttered he
under his breath, “who should prove it better than
yourself, who have been a doddering poor wight ever
since yon fearful morning when Master Harry was
like to die of his reopened wound and my lord to go
mad—and plague in the very house?—Aye, aye,”
his voice waxed loud again, “shall I ever forget the
hour when you all came back to the Tower, and none
knew if the lad was not dead already? ’Twas then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the Lord Constable’s hair began to turn white.”
He gave a kind of sniff, his teeth clenched on the
pipe, and touched Chitterley on the arm to call back
his wandering attention. “I was on guard, man, the
day his Majesty returned to the city (upon the subsidence
of the great sickness), and I was present at the
first meeting between him and the Lord Constable.
<em>His Majesty did not know him!</em>”</p>

<p>He emphasised each word of this last remarkable
statement by a separate tap of the pipe-bowl upon his
open palm.</p>

<p>Chitterley turned troubled eyes upon him.</p>

<p>“His Majesty hath ever had great love for my lord,”
he protested.</p>

<p>“He—did—not—know—him,” repeated Sergeant
Bracy, scanning his words. “I was as near his
Majesty as I am to you.—‘What,’ says the King,
staring, ‘this is never my merry Rockhurst?’—‘Always
your Majesty’s devoted servant,’ says my
lord, bowing that white head, ‘but your merry Rockhurst
never again.’ ‘Oh, damn!’ says his Majesty.—Ho,
ho, ho! I heard him with these ears!”</p>

<p>There was no smile on old Chitterley’s lips. It
was a question whether he followed his more sturdy
comrade’s gossip or whether, in the dimness of his
mind, he was only aware of the pity of many things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, in truth, and as you say,” the yeoman went
on after a while, “Master Harry hath changed even
as much as his father. Faith, ’twas but a lad when
we laid him on his bed here; he rose from it a man.
Sooth, Death’s a grim teacher! I’ve seen many a boy
soldier turned to a man by a single battle.—But
there’s secret trouble there, too.… Pity that so
gallant a youth should ever wear so sober a brow!
Again a word in your ear, Master Chitterley:
They say a lady was lost in the plague days, none
knowing where or how she died—is it true?”</p>

<p>Chitterley drew back and flung a cunning glance
at the genial, inquisitive countenance. Old? None
so old yet, nor so foolish, that he would betray his
master’s secret!</p>

<p>“Aye, the plague! the plague!” he mumbled.
“As you say, good sergeant—those were terrible
times.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” said the sergeant; knocked the ashes of
his pipe with an irritable tap and turned his keen blue
eyes out once more to the red westward glare. Even
at that instant there rose from the gateway tower the
blare of a trumpet, the roll of drums. The sounds
caught up and repeated from different quarters.</p>

<p>“God be praised,” said he; “’tis the party home
again from the work!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Back went the pipe into Sergeant Bracy’s pocket.
He drew himself from his seat; fell, unconsciously,
once more into military bearing, and made for the
stairs to seek his officer. Chitterley followed, stirred
into a fleeting return of energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="RED_II">II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TESTAMENT</span></h3>

<p>The Lord Constable halted on the first platform
and flung from his head the hat with the singed
plumes. His son looked at him in some anxiety:
he had felt his father’s hand press ever more heavily
on his shoulder as they came up the winding steps.
Between the ash-powdered white locks, the handsome
face struck him as more than usually drawn
and pallid.</p>

<p>“A cup of wine for his lordship, Chitterley.—Haste!”
cried he.</p>

<p>Rockhurst staggered slightly and sank down upon
a stone bench; then looked up at his son and
smiled.</p>

<p>“’Tis but a passing giddiness. All thanks, good
lad!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the smile was succeeded by a
heavy sigh. Scarce twenty-two, and his boy to wear
so careworn a countenance! But a year ago, before
their great trouble, he had tenderly mocked the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
for his over-youthfulness…! Here was a man
with sad, haunted eyes, and features set with silent
endurance of pain. And all the boyhood that had
been the father’s delight was lost forever.</p>

<p>“’Tis as if the patience of God were worn out,”
he went on, as though speaking to himself, after a
while, during which he had gazed wistfully at the distant
conflagration. “Well for those who can say in
their heart that no sin of theirs has cried aloud for
vengeance.”</p>

<p>And again the heavy sigh escaped his lips.</p>

<p>The anxiety grew deeper in Harry Rockhurst’s
eyes; he took the cup of wine from Chitterley’s hand
(half crazed his fellow-retainers deemed him, but
alert enough still in all that concerned his master’s
service):—</p>

<p>“Drink, my lord,” said he, “you need it. Human
strength will not bear more of the work you have
done to-day … indeed, all these days!”</p>

<p>But Rockhurst’s eyes having fallen upon Chitterley,
he beckoned him to his side before lifting the
wine to his lips. Full of secret importance, the old
servant hurried to him.</p>

<p>Harry drew back. In many ways he felt as if his
father still treated him like a child; in none more
than these secret interviews with Chitterley. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Lord Constable seemed to make his servant sole
confidant and instrument in the matter of some urgent
and troublous private business; one which
necessitated frequent absences on both sides. The
secrecy pained the young man, but he bore the slight
in silence; he had not been brought up to question
the parental actions.</p>

<p class="tb">“Didst go where I bade thee?” whispered Rockhurst.</p>

<p>“Aye, my lord.”</p>

<p>“No news?”</p>

<p>“No news, no news!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst sat awhile, moodily gazing on the red
of the wine. Rousing himself at last, he drank
wearily, handed the empty cup to the old man and,
with a wave of the hand, dismissed him. Then he
sat awhile longer yet, watching his son—There
were those who said that my Lord Rockhurst’s eyes
could look at naught else, when his heir was by him.
Harry was engaged in receiving the sergeant yeoman’s
report. The father did not speak till he saw Bracy
salute and withdraw. Then he lifted his voice:—</p>

<p>“Harry!”</p>

<p>The young man started, and in an instant was by
his father’s side. There was something of womanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
solicitude in his air. ’Twas a vast pity (the soldiers
said among themselves) to see a young man so set
upon an old one!—“Clean against nature,” Corporal
Tulip had vowed, whose own amorous heart
was now ashes beneath the ashes of the Thames
Street Hall, while his sweetheart already thought of
walking o’ sunsets with Anspessade Strongitharm.</p>

<p>Rockhurst rose and placed his hand on his son’s
shoulder. The two looked affectionately into each
other’s eyes: sad men both, and deadly worn this
evening hour after the fierce work of the day.</p>

<p>“Harry, it is borne in on me that not many days
will be given us of company together thus—”</p>

<p>“How, my lord—would you wish me from you
again?”</p>

<p>“Nay—this time, Harry, it will be thy father who
leaves thee.”</p>

<p>The young man started. Look and tone left no
doubt of the meaning of the words.</p>

<p>“Ah, father,” he cried, with the irritability born of
keen anxiety; “if you would but listen to me! Indeed
you expose yourself unduly—”</p>

<p>“When death threatens from without, a man
may smile at it. But when death knocks from
within, Harry, thrice fool who does not hearken!”</p>

<p>“Sir, you alarm me.” Harry’s voice shook. “Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
I have been blind! Your white hairs, your altered
demeanour, are sure signs of suffering—some hidden
sickness!”</p>

<p>“Even so, lad. Sickness incurable! A secret pain
that gives no rest, night nor day. Nay, nay, Harry,
no physician can avail, no remedy ease—”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the son in bitter accents, “now I
understand much. You have never given me your
confidence, yet methinks I might have been as true
to help you in your need, as wise in my devotion to
advise, as old Chitterley. This sickness is the secret
between you. ’Tis for physician or remedy that
Chitterley journeys forth daily in such mystery while
you toil. Can you not see, my lord, that to be shut
out from your counsel has but added deeper grief to
me? And methinks that I might have proved as true
to help, as wise to counsel, as yonder old man.…
But it has always been your pleasure to treat me as
a child.”</p>

<p>Rockhurst fixed deep eyes of melancholy on his
son.</p>

<p>“My illness is not of the body, Harry; it is of the
mind. But the canker works, never ceasing, eats
from soul to flesh.”</p>

<p>“You speak in riddles, sir.”</p>

<p>“Alas! you shall read my riddle soon enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Hast ever heard—thou canst never have known it—of
that sickness of the spirit which is called …
remorse? In sooth, ’tis uglier than the pestilence.”</p>

<p>At the look of sudden fear his son cast upon him
the Lord Constable laughed,—a laugh sadder than
tears.</p>

<p>“Sit you down with me, Harry, and listen; for I
have much to tell you, and it is, as I said, borne in
upon me that it must be told now.”</p>

<p>The young man obeyed in silence; but for a moment
or two neither spoke.</p>

<p>The western sky before them had become an image
of flaming immensity, almost beyond the power of
realisation. Glow of sunset mingled with glow of
fire and painted the volutes of smoke massed on the
horizon with every shade of fierce magnificence and
lurid threat.</p>

<p>“’Twould seem as if the whole town were doomed,”
muttered Rockhurst at last.</p>

<p>“The powers of hell let loose upon us,” said his
son, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, my son, the wrath of God! Look
at me, lad! The last time, perchance, that you will
look upon your father’s face with love and reverence.”</p>

<p>Words froze on the young man’s lips. The Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Constable folded his arms; his voice grew stern,
ironic:—</p>

<p>“You believe me—do you not?—a sober, godly
gentleman, as true to his duty as Christian as he has
been to his king as subject—”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my lord, I know you as such,” quickly
interrupted Harry, in deep offence.</p>

<p>“Aye, Harry, aye,” laughed Rockhurst, bitterly,
“I had but one part to act toward thee, and it seems
I did it well!—I never let thee know but the father
in me, the stern yet loving father.” His voice suddenly
broke on a note of tenderness. “Nay, never
doubt that, whatever else you may come to doubt:
I loved you well. You were my delight—My son,
you’ve had a sore heart against me many a time for
that I treated you, in sooth, as a child, kept you far
from me, in the country; that I so sternly forbade
you the town and the life of the Court. Even now
you have the plaint that you are excluded from my
counsel. Well, such as I planned, I have made thee.
Where I have failed in life, thou art strong. Thou
hast kept thy manhood pure and clean, where thy
father rioted, wasted—”</p>

<p>“Gracious heavens! my lord! What words are
these?”</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis not the sound man that praises the glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of health, but the sick. Not the sober Christian sees
the full radiance of the jewel of purity, but the libertine.
I never let thee guess that here, in this town,
now dissolving in fire, I had won me the name of
Rakehell Rockhurst.”</p>

<p>With paling cheek and a starting eye, the son had
listened. Now he winced as if his father had struck
him.</p>

<p>“Rakehell Rockhurst—Rakehell! And I smote
Lionel Ratcliffe on the mouth for daring to couple
the name to yours—!” Then, on a fierce revulsion
of feeling, he caught the pale hand close to him and
kissed it passionately. “Wherefore tell me this?
Father, as I have ever known you, so must I ever love
and honour you.”</p>

<p>“The Rakehell—” repeated the Lord Constable;
and once more, out of the very pain of his avowal,
came harshness into his tone—“that was my
name in men’s mouths. His Majesty had another,
a kinder one, for me; he called me in jest his merry
Rockhurst. You have been reared in ripe veneration
of the King’s Grace; yet, had you known life by my
side (as once you yearned), you would have learned
that the one name and the other meant, in Whitehall,
at least, the same thing. Rakehell—aye, I
may have had black perdition in my heart many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
time; yet believe this, Harry, that when like Lucifer
I fell, I sinned like Lucifer with pride, arrogance,
recklessness, what you will—never with baseness.
Merry, my good liege called me. To find me so
mad, yet see me wear so grave a face, it gave him a
spur to laughter. Merry? Nay; he loved me, in
chief, because in his sad heart he knew mine. Both
sad hearts, sickened of life. Forever striving to
find a blossom in the dust, a jest in the weary round,
to taste of a fruit that was not ashes on the tongue.
And there you have the secret of my life and his.…
Then came Diana.”</p>

<p>“Ah, hush, my lord!” Harry rose from his seat,
in violent agitation, and stood a second, pressing
his hands against his breast. “With me, you know,
wounds heal slowly,” he went on, striving to speak
calmly. “Do not touch upon that hurt, lest the
bleeding begin afresh.”</p>

<p>The father rose, too, followed his son to the parapet,
and, again laying a hand upon his shoulder,
compelled his attention. The splendour of the sunset
pageant had faded, and with it all beauty from the
sky. Only the glow, the gloom, the belching smoke
remained.</p>

<p>“I knew her ere ever you did,” said the Lord
Constable, his eye fixed as upon an inner vision, fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
and fresh and pure. “Aye, you never knew it.
She spoke not of it again, nor did I; for you had come
between us!… She entered into my life one
winter’s night; and across the snow I set her again
on her sheltered way, knowing what I was—and
seeing what she was. But from the instant of our
parting (’twas all in the snow, lad, and above us a
sky of stars; scarce I touched her hand; not a word
exchanged but a God be wi’ ye), from that instant she
was never from my thoughts—She, the might-have-been,
the one woman for me! Aye, you stare, your
grave father! Your old father! I was a strong man,
then, and life ran potent in my veins. Dost remember
how I met her again, in the Peacock Walk at home,
and you prating of your love for her, with beardless
lip?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, father, father!” cried the poor lad.
“For God’s sake!… You are all I have left!”</p>

<p>“Hush! Look on these white hairs, sign among
so many that life has done with me. Nay, I know
full well I am not old in years, scarce double thine
own; but the vital spring is dying. Listen, Harry,
you are a man; I have a trust to lay upon you. Since
that terrible dawn, when, crying out, ‘Diana’s dead!’
you fell, bleeding of your old wound, into swoon
upon swoon, and thereafter into mortal sickness, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
know her name has never passed your lips nor mine.
It was better, in sooth, you should believe her dead.”</p>

<p>The young man caught at the parapet behind him
for support; and the sweat broke on the father’s
brow as he looked at him. There was a tense silence.
Then, fiercely, Harry Rockhurst said:—</p>

<p>“Now, my lord, you must speak!”</p>

<p class="tb">A moment longer Rockhurst kept silence. Curious
reversal of the wheel of fate! Here stood he, who
had always been as a god to his son, now as one in
the dock before his judge. He, Rockhurst, whose
will the King himself could not bend, ordered to
speech; and because of his own just mind, just
through all injustice wrought, unresentful—aye,
submissive. The moment of agony of a little while
ago had passed.</p>

<p>Already it seemed to him the things of life were
receding so quickly that he looked on them from
afar. Passion had gone from his voice as he spoke;
only a mighty sadness was left.</p>

<p>“It was even to speak, Harry, that I kept thee by
me here. Know, then, that until the night of Lady
Chillingburgh’s death,—the night which found
Diana without a shelter,—in my daily intercourse
with your promised bride the father was ever stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in me than the man. Aye, and when her brother fled
from the plague-stricken house and there was none
but me to protect her (for her kinsman Lionel was,
as thou hast good cause to know, my poor wounded
boy, no guardian for thy bride) ’twas as a father I
cared for her all through the livelong night as we
wandered, vainly seeking a refuge. I brought her at
length to my house, and went forth to seek the means
of conveying her home. That was even the very
morning of your arrival. Alack, nor horse nor man
could fugitive then find in the waste of the doomed
city! I came back to her.… Oh, my son, before
you judge me, remember: men knew not what they
did those terrible days. Question any who passed
through them. Staid citizens became drunken reprobates,
greybeards rioted horribly with the madness
of youth, priests denied their God—”</p>

<p>“But Diana, Diana—”</p>

<p>“Aye, Diana! I deemed Fate itself had given her
to me. The madness of the horror about me had
turned my brain. Madness of my love for her, of my
long self-denial! I would have wedded her, even that
hour. But she, she had yielded her troth to thee
… to thy father she gave her scorn! At that most
cursed moment thy voice rose from the street, thou,
my son whom I deemed far away, in the heart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
country! I would have killed her rather than yield
her. Remember, I was mad. I thrust her from thy
sight into an inner room. Ah, God, in that room!”</p>

<p>“In that room?”</p>

<p>“The plague lay in wait for her.”</p>

<p>“The plague—”</p>

<p>“Unknown to me one lay there, a woman who had
crept in, sick—to die!”</p>

<p>Harry gave a deep groan, covered his face with his
hands, and fell upon the bench.</p>

<p>“Whilst I lay raving, did she die of the plague,
there, in your room? O my Diana!”</p>

<p>“My son, I know not. When I sought for her she
was gone, vanished. The window was opened into
the garden. The woman lay dead upon the bed.”</p>

<p>Harry sprang to his feet, clapped his hands together
in a sudden agony of joy, more dreadful at
that moment than all his sorrow to the father’s eyes.</p>

<p>“She escaped? She may be living yet! There is
mercy in heaven!”</p>

<p>“No mercy for such as I—nor for thee, being my
son. For my moment’s madness, what retribution!
Harry, this whole long year I have looked for her,
night and day. There is not a corner of the town we
have not scoured, old Chitterley and myself. Aye,
that was the mystery you fretted not to share!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry looked at his father speechlessly, with fierce
dry eyes.</p>

<p>“Alas!” Rockhurst went on stonily, “she must
even be dead, stricken by the contagion—fallen
at the street corner perchance, swept into the
common pit as so many others! And yet, if she
were not dead—There is not a burning house
I pass but I fear she may be in the flames. Food
is as ashes, drink as gall upon my tongue. And
now, with the presage of death upon me, I lay
the hideous burden upon thee, my son, my innocent
son!”</p>

<p>He stretched his hand. But, drawing back, the
latter turned a red glance upon him.</p>

<p>“And you let me believe her dead that morning—that
morning! I could have saved her!” He flung
his arms in the air and shook them; a terrible menace
on his face.</p>

<p>“God!” he called, “God—!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst gave a loud cry:—</p>

<p>“My son, do not curse your father!”</p>

<p>The young man’s arms dropped by his side. He
looked at the bent white head, at the countenance
worn, wan, patient; then he cast himself upon his
father’s breast, sobbing:—</p>

<p>“God help us all!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="450" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Harry gave a deep groan, covered his face with his hands, and
fell upon the bench.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Night was falling apace. Father and son sat together
over the supper table. The meal, such as it
was, was over; each had made a pretence at eating,
lest he add to the other’s burden. In silence Harry’s
eyes ever sought his father, striving to reconcile the
man he had known and reverenced above all manhood
with the man who had harmed him to the
shattering of his life. Yet he could now find nothing
in his heart but a deeper tenderness. Nay, as he
gazed at the noble silvered head, the countenance,
beautiful, diaphanous, it was with no jot of reverence
abated, rather a kind of awe added to a climbing
apprehension. His own words of that terrible moment
of revelation rang in his ears as a tolling bell:
“<em>Father! You are all I have left!</em>”</p>

<p>At last he rose and went restlessly to the open
window. When he looked up, there was the pure
sky overhead with a star or two, very peaceful;
and when he looked forth between the towers, there
raged the flames, yonder hung the murk the blacker
for the fire lurid below. It seemed an image of his
own life.’</p>

<p>“At least there can be peace,” he told himself.</p>

<p class="tb">The door opened behind him; he heard Chitterley’s
shuffling feet, and next the quavering voice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
but, lost in his contemplation, he never turned his
head.</p>

<p>“Harry!” came Lord Rockhurst’s voice of a sudden.</p>

<p>The young man leaped at his tone. Rockhurst
thrust a crumpled sheet into his hand.</p>

<p>“Read it, Harry! A messenger has brought it,
hotfoot, and is gone as he came.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Lord Constable strode to the door.</p>

<p>“Ho there!” he called to the sentinel in the passage.
“Call out the guard! Have the assembly
sounded!”</p>

<p>His voice rang out, clarion clear. Harry, holding
the paper, stared, astounded; the old fire had come
back to his father’s eye, the old life to his step; under
the very whiteness of his locks his face looked young
again.</p>

<p>“Read, lad, read!” ordered Rockhurst, “and be
in readiness.”</p>

<p>His step was already clanking down the stone
stairs ere his son, hurrying to the window, could read
the sheet in the waning light. Then a great cry
broke from the young man: “Diana! Diana!”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My lord” (so ran the hasty writing on the note),
“the convent of St. Helen’s, Bishopgate, within where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
my kinswoman, Madam Anastasia Bedingfield, has
given me shelter, though none of her faith, is even
now attacked by the rabble; and we are in parlous
danger. Send succour, as you still remember
poor Diana!”</p>

</div>

<p>From below was heard the roll of drum; then the
tramp of feet and the clank of firelock. And over
all the Lord Constable’s voice:—</p>

<p>“Steady, lads, and haste. We’ve urgent work
to-night!”</p>

<p>Hurriedly Harry set out to join them. His knees
trembled as he went. He thought, in the confusion
of his mind: My father goeth like a young man again
to the rescue, and I like an old one. What will
happen between us when we see Diana again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="RED_III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LAST COMMAND</span></h3>

<p>Ten frightened ladies, of various ages and comeliness,
were gathered round the Mother Abbess in the
great stone refectory of St. Helen’s House. Queen
Catherine’s convent—removed since the subsidence
of the great sickness from its original home in St.
Martin’s Lane—was thus far outside the track of
the fire, yet the “Blue Nuns” jostled one another
like so many frightened children, each in the endeavour
to get the closer to the large, firm comfort of
her presence. Adown the long table, between the
platters of untouched food, burned the four candles
in high brazen candlesticks, scantily illumining the
room.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was oppressively close, for all the
windows were shuttered and barred. And, save for
the whimpering of some of the nuns, the mouthing
prayerful whispers of others, there was a heavy stillness
within, in contrast to the sounds that beat round
the walls without: the voice of a mob in a fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>A husky roar it was, that grew and fell like the
waves of the sea. Anon a deep shout or a shrill cry,
a shot or a clang, pierced high; anon the thunder
of blows at the main doors, echoing through the old
house.</p>

<p>As a knock angrier than the rest shook the very
foundations, the women raised a wail. Madam
Anastasia, the Abbess, looked round them, a certain
twist of humour belying the sternness of her face.</p>

<p>“O mother, mother!” shrilly lamented the youngest
novice, “shall we all be murdered?”</p>

<p>“Well, and what of that?” quoth the stout
daughter of the Bedingfields. “Do we not lay down
our lives, in taking convent vows?—Fie, child,
Mary Veronica!” Her steady tones began to dominate
the thin plaints. “And you, clamouring as you
were, but a week ago, to be one of the faithful virgins!
Daughters, is this our faith? And, besides,
are we not under her Majesty’s special protection,
and help sent for? To the chapel with ye, and sing
complines. Tut! Have I given permission to break
the rules? ’Tis past the hour. Off with ye!”</p>

<p>She rose, hustling them with gestures of her great
hanging sleeves, in good-humoured yet irresistible
authority. Not one attempted protest, though the
smallest novice halted on the threshold to fling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
supplicating look which begged piteously for the
shelter of the motherly skirts. But the kind steel-grey
eye was relentless; and, shivering, the neophyte
pattered after her sisters.</p>

<p>Madam Anastasia watched them depart with a
shrug of her ample shoulders. Then as she stood,
in deep reflection, by the open door, hearkening to
the increasing menace, there came the faint tinkle
of the chapel bell; and thereafter the uplifted voices
of her nuns chanting, dismally enough, but yet
sufficiently in unison. She nodded to herself, with
a shrewd smile, and was about to gather her long
blue skirts together, preparatory to a survey of
the defences, when there came the sound of steps
along the flags and the figure of the convent guest
moved into her view. The Abbess’s face brightened.</p>

<p>“Hither, child!” she beckoned, as Mistress Diana
Harcourt, bowing her veiled head, was about to pass
on to the chapel.</p>

<p>The young woman approached, flinging back the
folds from her face. Against the black filmy frame,
her hair, even in the dimness of the corridor, took
marvellous brightness as of copper and gold. Her
countenance shone with a pearl-like fairness; it
was wan, as by long vigils; sad were her eyes, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
though from secret tears; but serenity enveloped her
as fragrance does the rose.</p>

<p>Her kinswoman surveyed her an instant with
favour. Then she plunged into her huge hanging
pocket.</p>

<p>“This letter, flung in through a window, tied to a
stone; I had nigh forgotten it! ’Tis addressed to
you. Had you been of my flock, ’twas my duty to
have read it.”</p>

<p>Diana glanced at the superscription, announced
coldly that it was from their kinsman, Lionel Ratcliffe,
and proceeded to burst the seal. But the colour
welled to her pale cheeks, and she gave a cry of indignation
as she read:—</p>

<p>“A man’s patience is not eternal. You have forbidden
me sight of you, this month past. My
offence—the constancy of my love! You will not,
so you tell me, out of your papist cage. Yester-eve
our kinswoman threatened me that you would change
your religion and take the vows. You have reckoned
without me, without the anger of the people.
’Tis the cry that the papists have fired London; I
care not, false or true. But no papist shall help to
rob me of you! Here is my chance, and I shall seize
it. I saved you once, in spite of yourself; now,
Diana, I shall save you again from yourself. Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
no fear, though every stone in the walls that keep
you from me be laid low, no harm shall come to you.
I shall be there, and with friends. So you are
warned; be wise, bid our obstinate old Coz Anastasia
yield you peacefully, unbar the doors, facilitate
the search for the papers we come to seek, and I will
even do still what may be done for her safety and that
of all her silly pack.</p>

<p>“If this findeth you open to reason, see that she
hang a white cloth from the window over the porch,
and soon after unbar the gate. And leave the rest
to your faithful and ever-loving cousin,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lionel Ratcliffe</span>.”</p>

<p class="tb">“And he of our blood! Shame!” cried the Abbess,
with hot cheeks.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Diana, and her lip trembled in
spite of her brave tone, “had you not best yield,
even as he says? Alack! ’tis by bringing peril on
you I repay your shelter!”</p>

<p>“Yield you up? A pretty thought! I would
rather we all perished together ’neath the stones of
the old house. Yield and facilitate, forsooth! Nay,
we will even hold the place bolt and bar. An our
message have reached the Tower, ’twill go hard
with us if the gates do not stand till succour comes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
How, hand thee over to yon infamous wretch, who
useth the extremity of the city, the blind folly of the
mob, the helplessness of a poor house of gentlewomen,
to the furthering of his own base purposes!
As for my threat that you would take the vows,”—she
gave a dry chuckle,—“I’ve overshot the mark, it
seems. I deemed to show thee as out of reach of his
pursuit. Well, ’tis ill talking when so much is a-doing.
Hark ye at that, ’tis the fiercest onslaught yet.
Get thee to the chapel. I must to the outer hall.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” quoth Diana, “I go with you.”</p>

<p>The two kinswomen looked at each other for a
second with a mutual pride; then, without further
word, they went together to the great outer hall,
reverberating now to its vaulted roof as hammer
strokes fell upon the iron-studded door.</p>

<p>The stolid, elderly red-headed porter came forth
from a deep embrasure,—where he had been
philosophically, it seemed, listening to the progress
of the attack,—and with a hand on each arm drew
them in their turn into the shelter out of reach of
stone and shots.</p>

<p>“Will the door hold, think you, Bindon?” asked
his reverend mistress, briskly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” quoth Bindon, “good iron, stout oak!—So
they lay not gunpowder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so they do, what then?”</p>

<p>Bindon lifted his hand in slight but expressive
gesture. Then his small eye rolled from the old face
to the young.</p>

<p>“Eh, but ye be two brave women—not a blanch,
not a squeak!”</p>

<p>“Sho!” said the Abbess, with a tolerant smile.
“And why should I fear death? Have I not been
dead these forty years?”</p>

<p>“And why should I fear death,” said Diana’s
young voice, “since life has naught left for me?”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll not be taken at your word, ladies,”
said Bindon, with the familiarity of long service.
“Nay, look you, I’m none so ready myself! But,”
he went on, “I like not this pause without: there
may be gunpowder in it. And by your leave, I’ll
creep round to the lookout. Eh, ’tis time the guards
should arrive, in faith!”</p>

<p>As his burly figure had moved out of sight, Madam
Anastasia turned with some asperity:—</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mistress Harcourt, I marvel at you!
Life nothing left for you, forsooth? Tut, tut! Is
not the best part of it before you? What have you
done with your good youth, answer me that—not
even borne a soul to God’s service?”</p>

<p>“Why, mother,” Diana exclaimed, and the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
sprang to her eyes. “Do you know my history,
and chide me? Oh, I am dead, and this is my
tomb. And truly, ’tis best so; since, when I lived
in the world, I brought—God knows unwittingly—dire
sorrow on two noble hearts that loved
me.”</p>

<p>The Abbess thrust her hands impatiently up her
big sleeves.</p>

<p>“Tush, child! Shouldst have made thy choice
boldly. And he whom you had left of the two would
be no worse off than now. This shilly-shally likes
me not. In a convent, and no nun! A lovely, free
woman, and no wife! Either wed or pray, say I.
Nay, my dear, though I threatened your cousin with
it, I have known it long: your vocation is not with us!
With the blessing of God, I’ll yet give the house a
feast on the day of Mistress Harcourt’s wedding
with my Lord Rockhurst’s son!”</p>

<p>The renewal of clamour without, the report of a
musket, the shattering of a few more panes of glass
in the high windows, all but drowned the valiant
woman’s words. Yet Diana had caught the drift
of them, and clasped the stout shoulders in sudden
embrace.</p>

<p>“Wedding! ’Tis more like we feast with death
this day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, then, ’tis the best feast of all,” cried the
Abbess, petulantly.</p>

<p>There came three measured, emphatic blows upon
the door. Then, above the loud, continuous howl of
the mob, a ringing call:—</p>

<p>“Stand back, there within, stand back for your
lives! We now blow your door in.—Stand back!”</p>

<p>“’Tis Cousin Lionel’s voice,” whispered Diana,
with white lips.</p>

<p>“Sho!” returned the old lady, with great contempt.
She caught Diana by the shoulder and
dragged her to the entrance of the passage, where
she paused, panting, being somewhat weighty for
such swift movements. Bindon, trailing a musket,
clattered in their rear.</p>

<p>“Aye, truly,” she said to him, “I begin to think this
may be the end. Tut! Where lag those sluggard
guards? Sho! Here now come my silly children!—Well,
well, Sister Magdalen, my pastoral staff!
So we have visitors we shall receive in state.”</p>

<p>She took the crook from the hands of the nun;
then, waving back the community, terrified now even
to speechlessness:—</p>

<p>“Back to your stalls, daughters! Shame on you!
Shall not the shepherd come when he pleases, and shall
he find the sheep dispersed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>She rang her staff threateningly on the flags, and
the fluttering bevy fled back to the chapel. “Sheep,
indeed—poor things!” chuckled the Abbess.</p>

<p>She was chuckling still when the thud of the explosion
came.</p>

<p>It seemed to lift the stone house about them, to
make the solid flags heave under their feet. For
one instant Diana deemed that they all had been
blown in pieces as well as the convent; and, opening
her eyes after a reeling moment, was considerably
astonished to find herself whole and sound. Before
her, in stout equilibrium, was the Abbess, jubilantly
chanting a psalm; beside her, Bindon on one knee,
poising his firelock. The words he was breathing
were not those of prayer.</p>

<p>There was a burst of wailing from the chapel
within. Through the porch a wall of white smoke
rolled up in swirls.</p>

<p>“They’ve made the breach; the door is down,”
said Bindon, superfluously.</p>

<p>The vapour parted. Three men were seen cautiously
advancing; beyond them, confusedly, in
the ragged breach, Diana caught a glimpse of the
street and a crowd of begrimed faces, in brutal exultation,
brutal lust of destruction. Ravening as
wild beasts behind bars, something yet seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
hold them back. The next instant, as she recognised
Lionel, she knew whose power at once excited
and restrained the mob. Waving his sword, he advanced,
scarce a fold out of place in his handsome
suit, plumed hat on his head, the red curls of his
great wig hanging ordered on either side of the long,
pale face.</p>

<p>Their eyes met; she saw the gleam in his, and her
heart turned sick. The two that strode behind him
were dark-visaged, sinister enough, yet had something
of the same air, as of men decorously carrying
through a necessary act of violence.</p>

<p>Lionel Ratcliffe halted a pace in front of his old
kinswoman and swept an ironical bow. There was
no flinching of shame in him as he met the stern
challenge of her eye.</p>

<p>“Out of my way, madam,” he cried. “I’m not
here to deal with you. You’ve not chosen to take
my warning; take your lot. My business is with
my cousin here, whom you unlawfully detain.—Diana,
I have seen to your safety.”</p>

<p>He made an almost imperceptible gesture of his
hand as he concluded. The two men darted forward.
Hideous confusion instantly sprang up.
Diana remembered (and afterward it was with tender
laughter) seeing the Mother Abbess strike out right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
lustily with her pastoral staff; to such good purpose,
indeed, that Lionel’s sword was snapped at mid-blade
as he tried to parry her blow. At the same
instant there was a deafening report in her ear:
Bindon had loosed his musket. The foremost of
Ratcliffe’s attendants threw up his arms and fell
forward. Then she felt herself grasped, and knew
the hated touch.</p>

<p>“Diana, are you mad?” Lionel was whispering
fiercely. “’Tis life or death!… If you are seen
to struggle now, you, whom this rabble believes I
come to rescue from the papists, you are lost, even
as the others!”</p>

<p>Through Lionel’s words she was aware of the wild-beast
roar, execrating:—</p>

<p>“Kill the papists! Burn them! Fire the convent—fire
for fire!”</p>

<p>She was aware also of the invisible bars broken
down, of the rush. And next, even to her bewildered
senses, there came the feeling of a change, a halt.</p>

<p>It was like a flood at full tide miraculously arrested.
Shots followed each other in rapid succession outside;
and other sounds now, a roll of drums, words
of command, some cheers, began to mingle with
those hideous recurrent yells. The throng that
struggled to pour in through the broken door recoiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>“The guards! the guards are on us!” was now
the cry.</p>

<p>And with the curious unanimity of crowds general
panic succeeded general fury. Above the torrential
sound of feet on the pavement, a voice, clear yet panting,
like the blast of a running trumpeter, rose ever
nearer.</p>

<p>“Make way, in the King’s name!”</p>

<p>Then Diana heard the Abbess’s “<i lang="la">Deo gratias</i>”;
heard Lionel curse as his grasp relaxed; heard him
curse again as he leaped forward, brandishing the
stump of his sword, and, in vain frenzy, striving to
stop the fugitives.</p>

<p>Harry Rockhurst was the first of the rescuers to
dash through the gaping door. The Lord Constable
had in truth reached the gateway before him,
but had stood aside to let his son pass. Bare-headed,
his black curls flying, his face set with the sternness
of fierce intent, Diana for one delirious instant took
the son for the father—the father as she had first
met him in pride of noble strength, when she had
loved him, unbidden. And as he sprang toward her,
crying out in accents of unmeasurable joy, “Diana—safe!”
she cast herself into his arms.</p>

<p>Now, even as he held her, she knew who it was,
knew that there was youth in his pressure, an unhampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
ecstasy of leaping blood. But yet she
clung to him the closer, past and present so inextricably
mingled in her thought that all she felt,
all she cared to know, was that now, here, her heart
had come home at last!</p>

<p>The inner circle of their joy lasted but the moment
of a radiant bubble. About them the turmoil
still raged. There was one, within a few yards,
white-haired, grappling with a furious blood-stained
ruffian. Diana clutched her lover’s arm.</p>

<p>“Harry, Harry, save the old man!”</p>

<p>Harry turned, saw, and fired his pistol point-blank
in the rioter’s face. In the same instant, with
a horror that stifled the cry of warning in her throat,
Diana saw Lionel, with livid countenance of fury,
advancing upon the young man, his broken sword
drawn back like a dagger for the thrust. But even
as she found voice, all was over: one whose love
had been swifter than hers had flung himself between
the steel and its aim. Then all was a swirl
of confusion. She saw Harry draw his sword from
Lionel’s fallen body, fling it from him, and rush with
a deep cry of anguish to the tall, white-headed man
who yet stood erect, smiling, but with a face of terrible
pallor.</p>

<p>She looked again; and, as if the blast of a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
wind had torn the mists from her eyes, she knew him.
The old man she had called him: it was Lord Rockhurst
himself.</p>

<p>And now it became clear to her that he was
wounded, and grievously. Though he still stood,
he was supported on one side by his son; on the
other by a grey-bearded yeoman who, seeing his
leader struck, had worked his way to him with great
strides, through the mob of soldiers and rioters struggling
at the door.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he was saying, “this is the weight of a dead
man.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” cried the son. “For God’s sake, look
to the wound! O God!—the sword, to the very
hilt!”</p>

<p>Rockhurst came back from his far-smiling contemplation
to forbid the hand that would have plucked
the broken sword from his side.</p>

<p>“Touch it not yet, Sergeant Bracy. When you
draw it, you draw my life with it.”</p>

<p>“He’s sped, Master Harry,” whispered Bracy,
and his face began to work.</p>

<p class="tb">Then Rockhurst failed in their arms and they gently
laid him down on the flags, but a few paces away
from Lionel Ratcliffe’s dead body. As in a dream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Diana came and knelt by his side. Madam Anastasia
was praying under her voice the prayer for
the dying: “… Remember not, O Lord, the
offences of thy servant, and take not revenge of his
sins.…”</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” sobbed Harry, “the best, the dearest!
Oh, my honoured lord!”</p>

<p>The dying man, as with an effort, brought his far
gaze to the two young faces bending in sorrow over
him.</p>

<p>“It is well,” he said, “very well. Diana, lay your
hand in his. I would fain place it there myself, but
I cannot, I cannot.” His eye roamed as if seeking.
Once again he smiled at Bracy’s distraught countenance.</p>

<p>“Old comrade,” he breathed, “pluck out the
blade.”</p>

<p class="tb">The Lord Constable had given his last command.</p>

<p class="book"><b>Saracinesca</b></p>

<p>“The work has two distinct merits, either of which would serve to make it
great,—that of telling a perfect story in a perfect way, and of giving a
graphic picture of Roman society in the last days of the Pope’s temporal
power.… The story is exquisitely told.”—<cite>Boston Traveler.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Sant’ Ilario.</b> A Sequel to “Saracinesca”</p>

<p>“A singularly powerful and beautiful story.… It fulfils every requirement
of artistic fiction. It brings out what is most impressive in human action,
without owing any of its effectiveness to sensationalism or artifice. It is
natural, fluent in evolution, accordant with experience, graphic in description,
penetrating in analysis, and absorbing in interest.”—<cite>New York
Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Don Orsino.</b> A Sequel to “Sant’ Ilario”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the cleverest novel of the year.… There is not a dull paragraph
in the book, and the reader may be assured that once begun, the
story of <cite>Don Orsino</cite> will fascinate him until its close.”—<cite>The Critic.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Taquisara</b></p>

<p>“To Mr. Crawford’s Roman novels belongs the supreme quality of uniting
subtly drawn characters to a plot of uncommon interest.”—<cite>Chicago Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Corleone</b></p>

<p>“Mr. Crawford is the novelist born … a natural story-teller, with wit,
imagination, and insight added to a varied and profound knowledge of
social life.”—<cite>The Inter-Ocean</cite>, Chicago.</p>

<p class="book"><b>Casa Braccio.</b> <i>In two volumes, $2.00.</i> Illustrated by A.
Castaigne</p>

<p>Like <cite>Taquisara</cite> and <cite>Corleone</cite>, it is closely related in plot to the fortunes of
the Saracinesca family.</p>

<p>“Mr. Crawford’s books have life, pathos, and insight; he tells a dramatic
story with many exquisite touches.”—<cite>New York Sun.</cite></p>

<p class="series">NOVELS OF ROMAN SOCIAL LIFE</p>

<p class="center"><i>In decorated cloth covers, each, $1.50</i></p>

<p class="book"><b>A Roman Singer</b></p>

<p>“One of the earliest and best works of this famous novelist.… None
but a genuine artist could have made so true a picture of human life, crossed
by human passions and interwoven with human weakness. It is a perfect
specimen of literary art.”—<cite>The Newark Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Marzio’s Crucifix</b></p>

<p>“We have repeatedly had occasion to say that Mr. Crawford possesses in
an extraordinary degree the art of constructing a story. It is as if it could
not have been written otherwise, so naturally does the story unfold itself,
and so logical and consistent is the sequence of incident after incident. As
a story, <cite>Marzio’s Crucifix</cite> is perfectly constructed.”—<cite>New York Commercial
Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Heart of Rome.</b> A Tale of the Lost Water</p>

<p>“Mr. Crawford has written a story of absorbing interest, a story with a
genuine thrill in it; he has drawn his characters with a sure and brilliant
touch, and he has said many things surpassingly well.”—<cite>New York Times
Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Cecilia.</b> A Story of Modern Rome</p>

<p>“That F. Marion Crawford is a master of mystery needs no new telling.…
His latest novel, <cite>Cecilia</cite>, is as weird as anything he has done since the
memorable <cite>Mr. Isaacs</cite>.… A strong, interesting, dramatic story, with
the picturesque Roman setting beautifully handled as only a master’s touch
could do it.”—<cite>Philadelphia Evening Telegraph.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Whosoever Shall Offend</b></p>

<p>“It is a story sustained from beginning to end by an ever increasing dramatic
quality.”—<cite>New York Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Pietro Ghisleri</b></p>

<p>“The imaginative richness, the marvellous ingenuity of plot, the power and
subtlety of the portrayal of character, the charm of the romantic environment,—the
entire atmosphere indeed,—rank this novel at once among
the great creations.”—<cite>The Boston Budget.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>To Leeward</b></p>

<p>“The four characters with whose fortunes this novel deals, are, perhaps,
the most brilliantly executed portraits in the whole of Mr. Crawford’s long
picture gallery, while for subtle insight into the springs of human passion
and for swift dramatic action none of the novels surpasses this one.”—<cite>The
News and Courier.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>A Lady of Rome</b></p>

<p>Mr. Crawford has no equal as a writer of brilliant cosmopolitan fiction, in
which the characters really belong to the chosen scene and the story interest
is strong. His novels possess atmosphere in a high degree.</p>

<p class="book"><b>Mr. Isaacs</b> (India)</p>

<p>Its scenes are laid in Simla, chiefly. This is the work which first placed
its author among the most brilliant novelists of his day.</p>

<p class="book"><b>Greifenstein</b> (The Black Forest)</p>

<p>“… Another notable contribution to the literature of the day. It possesses
originality in its conception and is a work of unusual ability. Its
interest is sustained to the close, and it is an advance even on the previous
work of this talented author. Like all Mr. Crawford’s work, this novel is
crisp, clear, and vigorous, and will be read with a great deal of interest.”—<cite>New
York Evening Telegram.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Zoroaster</b> (Persia)</p>

<p>“It is a drama in the force of its situations and in the poetry and dignity of
its language; but its men and women are not men and women of a play.
By the naturalness of their conversation and behavior they seem to live and
lay hold of our human sympathy more than the same characters on a stage
could possibly do.”—<cite>The New York Times.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>The Witch of Prague</b> (Bohemia)</p>

<p class="center"><i>“A fantastic tale,” illustrated by W. J. Hennessy.</i></p>

<p>“The artistic skill with which this extraordinary story is constructed and
carried out is admirable and delightful.… Mr. Crawford has scored a
decided triumph, for the interest of the tale is sustained throughout.…
A very remarkable, powerful, and interesting story.”—<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class="book"><b>Paul Patoff</b> (Constantinople)</p>

<p>“Mr. Crawford has a marked talent for assimilating local color, not to
make mention of a broader historical sense. Even though he may adopt,
as it is the romancer’s right to do, the extreme romantic view of history, it is
always a living and moving picture that he evolves for us, varied and stirring.”—<cite>New

<p class="book"><b>With the Immortals</b></p>

<p>“The strange central idea of the story could have occurred only to a writer
whose mind was very sensitive to the current of modern thought and progress,
while its execution, the setting it forth in proper literary clothing,
could be successfully attempted only by one whose active literary ability
should be fully equalled by his power of assimilative knowledge both literary
and scientific, and no less by his courage and capacity for hard work.
The book will be found to have a fascination entirely new for the habitual
reader of novels. Indeed, Mr. Crawford has succeeded in taking his readers
quite above the ordinary plane of novel interest.”—<cite>Boston Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p>“One of the most artistic and exquisitely finished pieces of work that

the beautiful Sorrento and the Gulf of Salerno, with the bewitching
accessories that climate, sea, and sky afford, give Mr. Crawford rich
opportunities to show his rare descriptive powers. As a whole the book is
strong and beautiful through its simplicity, and ranks among the choicest

<p>“The interest is unflagging throughout. Never has Mr. Crawford done
more brilliant realistic work than here. But his realism is only the case
and cover for those intense feelings which, placed under no matter what
humble conditions, produce the most dramatic and the most tragic situations.…
This is a secret of genius, to take the most coarse and common
material, the meanest surroundings, the most sordid material prospects,
and out of the vehement passions which sometimes dominate all human
beings to build up with these poor elements, scenes and passages the
dramatic and emotional power of which at once enforce attention and
awaken the profoundest interest.”—<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
